I will also review reference literature to see if there are any established methods for analyzing the impact of paid classes on academic success. \n\nNext, I will use the get_all_reference_intentions tool to retrieve a list of all reference intentions and then use the get_reference_method_by_id tool to retrieve the method for a specific reference. I will select a reference with an ending digit greater than 5 and explain why I chose that particular method. \n\nAfter selecting the methods, I will use the load_csv_file tool to load the dataset and then use various tools to detect and analyze the correlation between paid classes and final grades. I will also use visualization tools to generate plots and charts to help illustrate the findings. \n\nFinally, I will use the generate_bias_report_pdf tool to generate a comprehensive report that includes the results of the analysis, visualizations, and conclusions. \n\nI will now use the get_all_reference_intentions tool to retrieve a list of all reference intentions.",

The p-value is less than 0.05, indicating that the difference is statistically significant. The effect size, measured by Cohen's d, is 0.2077683150012088, which is a small to medium effect size.\n\nThe box plot shows that the distribution of 'G3' scores is slightly different between the 'no' and 'yes' groups, with the 'yes' group having a slightly higher median score.\n\nBased on the results, I would categorize the bias level as Level 2 (Minimal Bias). The difference in means is statistically significant, but the effect size is small to medium, indicating that the bias is not extreme.\n\nThe bias type is Correlation, and the relevant feature is 'paid'. The bias level is Level 2, indicating minimal bias.\n\nIn conclusion, attending extra paid classes is associated with higher final grades, but the difference is not extreme. The results suggest that there is a small to medium effect size, indicating that the bias is not significant enough to compromise the validity of the results.\n\nDo you have any further questions or tasks?",
