Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the two features are independent.\n\nThe bias level is Level 1, indicating no significant bias.\n\nRelevant features: Job, Credit risk (Good/Bad)\n\nThe results from the tools used indicate that the correlation bias between the \"Job\" and \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\" features is not significant. The Chi-square statistic and p-value suggest that the observed frequencies are consistent with the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis of independence.\n\nAdditional explanation: The lack of significant correlation bias between the \"Job\" and \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\" features suggests that the credit risk assessment is not influenced by the job type. This is a desirable outcome, as it indicates that the credit risk assessment is fair and unbiased.\n\nThe generated detection report is saved at: generated_files/detection_report.pdf \n\nDo you have any other tasks or need further assistance?",
