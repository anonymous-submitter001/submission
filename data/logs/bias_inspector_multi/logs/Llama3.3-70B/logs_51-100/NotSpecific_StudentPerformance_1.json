The bias level is Level 5, indicating extreme bias.\n\nThe findings are as follows:\n\n* The Chi-Square test indicates a significant deviation from the expected distribution, with a Chi-Square value of 319.0506329113924.\n* The Shannon entropy calculation suggests a biased distribution, with a Shannon entropy value of 0.28907945973164645.\n* The bar chart for the 'higher' column shows a significant imbalance in the distribution.\n* The contingency table for 'higher' and 'sex' shows a significant association between the two features, with a Chi-Square value of 7.685935036164814 and a p-value of 0.005565283789132666.\n\nThese findings suggest that there is a significant bias in the 'higher' column, which may be related to the 'sex' feature.\n\nA detailed report has been generated and saved at generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf.\n\nDo you have any further questions or would you like to explore other aspects of the dataset?",
