This suggests that the null hypothesis of independence can be rejected, and there is a strong bias between these two features.\n\nThe results of the t-test also suggest a significant difference in the means of the 'Credit amount' feature between the two groups defined by the 'Property' feature. However, the effect size calculation (Cohen's d) is not applicable in this case due to the nature of the data.\n\nOverall, the analysis suggests that the dataset shows a significant correlation bias between the 'Property' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)' features, which may impact the accuracy of models trained on this dataset.\n\nAdditional explanation:\n\nThe bias between the 'Property' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)' features may be due to various factors, such as differences in credit risk assessment or lending practices.
