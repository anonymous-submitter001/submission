The N-Sigma values range from -0.4228 to 0.1073, indicating that there is some bias in the data.\n\nTo better understand the relationship between these two features, I would like to generate a grouped bar chart to visualize the distribution of the \"Installment rate in percentage of disposable income\" feature for each category of the \"Personal status and sex\" feature.\n\nPlease let me proceed with generating the grouped bar chart.\n\nLet's refine our approach and ensure we are using the most effective bias detection tools.\n\nI will now use the plot_grouped_bar_chart tool to generate the grouped bar chart.\n\nPlease see below for the next step:\n\n COMPLETE TASK\n\nI will now generate a PDF report based on the results and provide a detailed summary of the conclusions.\n\nPlease see below for the PDF report generation:\n\nLet's refine our approach and ensure we are using the most effective bias detection tools.\n\nI will now use the generate_bias_report_pdf tool to generate the PDF report.\n\nPlease see below for the next step:\n\n COMPLETE TASK\n\nThe PDF report has been generated and saved at: generated_files/bias_report.pdf\n\nPlease find the detailed summary of the conclusions below:\n\nBias Type: Correlation\nRelevant Feature(s): Personal status and sex, Installment rate in percentage of disposable income\nBias Level: Level 2\n\nBased on the analysis, it appears that there is a minimal bias in the data.
