The Shannon entropy value is 0.9437954138017224, which indicates a moderate level of uncertainty or randomness in the distribution. The balance metric is 0.1750259377934334, which suggests that the distribution is not well-balanced, with some categories having much higher frequencies than others. The max/min ratio is 29170.0, which indicates a very high level of imbalance in the distribution, with the most frequent category having a much higher frequency than the least frequent category.\n\nBased on these results, it is clear that the native country distribution in the Adult.csv dataset exhibits extreme bias, with some categories being heavily overrepresented and others being underrepresented. This bias could have significant implications for any analysis or modeling tasks that rely on this dataset, and it is essential to consider and address this bias to ensure accurate and reliable results.\n\nThe PDF report has been generated and saved at: generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or need any additional assistance!",
