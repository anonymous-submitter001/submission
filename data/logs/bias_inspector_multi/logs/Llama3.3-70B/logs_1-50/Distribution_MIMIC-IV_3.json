The balance metric is 0.48257982715547837, and the max/min ratio is 657.0, which indicates a significant imbalance in the distribution of patient races.\n\nThe bias level is categorized as Level 4 (Significant Bias), which means that the bias is prominent and may impact the accuracy of analysis in certain contexts.\n\nIt is recommended to consider this bias when using the dataset for analysis and to take appropriate measures to mitigate its effects.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",
