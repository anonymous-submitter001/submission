Based on the skewness value, I would categorize the bias level as Level 3 (Moderate Bias). The results from the 'numerical_distribution_skewness' tool indicate a moderate level of bias, with a skewness value of 0.6321422002561792. The box plot also shows a moderate level of variation in the 'studytime' values. Overall, the dataset shows a moderate level of bias in the distribution of 'studytime'.\n\nDo you have any other questions or tasks you'd like me to help you with?",
