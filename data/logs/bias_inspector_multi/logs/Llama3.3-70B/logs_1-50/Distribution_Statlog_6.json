This suggests that there may be some bias in the distribution of debtors and guarantors.\n\nThe skewness of the \"Credit amount\" column is 1.9496276798326209, which indicates a moderate level of skewness. This suggests that the distribution of credit amounts may be slightly asymmetric.\n\nThe Cramér's V correlation coefficient between the \"Other debtors / guarantors\" and \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\" columns is 0.08151911761828783, which indicates a weak correlation between the two columns. This suggests that there may be some relationship between the number of debtors and guarantors and the credit risk.\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient between the \"Credit amount\" and \"Age in years\" columns is 0.03271641666544814, which indicates a weak correlation between the two columns. This suggests that there may be some relationship between the credit amount and the age of the borrower.\n\nBased on these results, the overall bias level is Level 3 (Moderate Bias). The relevant features are \"Other debtors / guarantors\", \"Credit amount\", and \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\". \n\nThe bias extent is moderate, with some bias in the distribution of debtors and guarantors, and a weak correlation between the number of debtors and guarantors and the credit risk. The credit amount distribution is slightly asymmetric, and there is a weak correlation between the credit amount and the age of the borrower.\n\nIn conclusion, the dataset shows a moderate level of bias, with some bias in the distribution of debtors and guarantors, and a weak correlation between the number of debtors and guarantors and the credit risk. The credit amount distribution is slightly asymmetric, and there is a weak correlation between the credit amount and the age of the borrower. \n\nThe results are summarized in the generated detection report, which can be found at \"generated_files/detection_report.pdf\". \n\nDo you have any further questions or would you like to proceed with another task?",
