By examining the chart, we can see that there are some categories with very low frequencies, which may indicate bias in the data.\n\nTo further analyze the bias, I used the categorical_distribution_entropy function to calculate the entropy and normalized entropy for the 'Credit history' feature. The normalized entropy is 0.7372635312349725, which is below 0.95, indicating that there may be some bias in the distribution of the 'Credit history' feature.\n\nBased on the results, I conclude that the bias level is Level 3 (Moderate Bias). The distribution of the 'Credit history' feature shows some bias, with a balance metric of 0.7372635312349725 and a normalized entropy of 0.7372635312349725. The bar chart shows that there are some categories with very low frequencies, which may indicate bias in the data.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",
