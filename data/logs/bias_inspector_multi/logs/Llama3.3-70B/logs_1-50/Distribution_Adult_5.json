The bias level is Level 2 (Minimal Bias). \n\nBased on the analysis, the distribution of occupations in the Adult.csv dataset shows a minimal bias, with a relatively even distribution and moderate uncertainty. The bar chart provides a visual representation of the occupation distribution, showing the frequency of each occupation.\n\nThe bias level is categorized as Level 2, indicating that while there is some disparity between the most and least frequent occupations, the distribution is generally even.\n\nThe PDF report generated provides a detailed summary of the findings, including the bias type, relevant feature, and bias level, along with the visual representation of the occupation distribution.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",
