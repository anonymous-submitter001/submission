This indicates that there is a noticeable difference in the representation of students from urban and rural areas.\n\nThe bar chart visualization of the 'address' column distribution provides a clear representation of the bias, with a higher proportion of students from urban areas.\n\nThe generated PDF report provides a comprehensive summary of the findings and recommendations for addressing the bias.\n\nIn conclusion, the bias level in the 'address' column is categorized as Level 3, indicating a moderate level of bias. The results from the 'categorical_distribution_shannon_balance' and 'categorical_distribution_max_min_ratio' tools support this conclusion.\n\nThe findings suggest that the dataset may not be fully representative of the population, and further analysis or data collection may be necessary to ensure accuracy and fairness.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",
