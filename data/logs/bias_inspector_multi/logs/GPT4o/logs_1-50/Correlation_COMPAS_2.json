Here's a summary of the work:\n\n1. **Visualization**: A box plot illustrating the distribution of assessment scores across genders has been created. This visual representation helps in understanding the score distribution better (see the image: `generated_files/box_plot_gender_scores.png`).\n\n2. **Detection Report**: A detailed PDF report summarizing the analysis has been generated, including the statistical findings and visual elements (see the report: `generated_files/gender_bias_detection_report.pdf`).\n\n### Summary for the User:\n- **Bias Type**: Correlation\n- **Relevant Features**: Gender (`Sex_Code_Text`) and Assessment Scores (`RawScore`)\n- **Bias Level**: Level 2 (Minimal Bias)\n  - The T-test showed a significant statistical difference with a low p-value, but Cohen's d and Standardized Difference indicated minimal practical bias.\n- **Conclusion**: The dataset is fairly balanced with respect to gender and assessment scores, showing minimal bias, which suggests it can be used confidently with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional analysis, feel free to let me know! I'll also confirm with Advisor Assistant that everything is satisfactory.",
