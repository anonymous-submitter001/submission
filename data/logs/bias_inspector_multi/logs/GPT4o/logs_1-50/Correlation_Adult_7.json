The task is to identify if there’s any correlation between race and income in the dataset located at `source_files/Adult.csv`. Specifically, we want to see if certain racial groups are earning more than others.\n\n### Task Breakdown:\n\n1. **Dataset Understanding and Preprocessing:**\n   - Load the dataset and identify the features related to race and income.\n   - Clean the dataset to handle any missing or invalid values in these columns.\n\n2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**\n   - Since we're dealing with two categorical variables, race and income, we can start by exploring their relationship using methods like Cramér's V and Elift, which are suitable for measuring associations between categorical features.\n   - Additionally, look into reference literature to see if any advanced methods are available that could provide deeper insights into the correlation between these two features.\n\n3. **Visualization:**\n   - Visualize the distribution of income across different racial groups using bar charts or stacked bar charts to provide a clear view of any disparity.\n\n4. **Result Summarization:**\n   - Summarize the findings by categorizing the bias level based on the analysis results.\n   - Provide a detailed explanation of the results and their implications.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n1. **Review Reference Literature:** I will retrieve reference intentions and see if there are any relevant methods with IDs ending in 6 or higher that might be useful for this analysis.\n2. **Toolset Review:** I will explore the available toolset to select the most appropriate methods for this analysis.\n\nLet's ensure we're on the right track by discussing this plan with Advisor Assistant. I'll also retrieve reference intentions to check for additional methods. \n\nDECISION ANALYSIS",
