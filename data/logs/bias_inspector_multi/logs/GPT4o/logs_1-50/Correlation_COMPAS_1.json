This can help in intuitively conveying the results to stakeholders.\n\n2. **Bias Level Assessment**:\n   - **Bias Type**: Correlation\n   - **Relevant Features**: Gender (Sex_Code_Text) and Recommended Supervision Level (RecSupervisionLevelText)\n   - **Bias Level**: Given the significant p-value, this correlation might be classified under a higher bias level. You can consider categorizing it as \"Extreme Bias\" given the strong statistical evidence.\n\n3. **Review Alternative Methods**:\n   - Consider employing other correlation measures from the reference literature or toolset to corroborate the findings.\n   - Although the Chi-Square test is robust, checking with Total Variation Distance or Statistical Parity can provide additional insights.\n\n4. **Summary Report**:\n   - Prepare a comprehensive bias report including visualizations, interpretation of statistical values, and potential implications.\n   - Ensure the PDF report contains a detailed explanation of methods and findings for clarity.\n\nIf these steps align with your analysis plan, we can proceed to implement the suggested visualizations and report generation to conclude this task effectively.",
