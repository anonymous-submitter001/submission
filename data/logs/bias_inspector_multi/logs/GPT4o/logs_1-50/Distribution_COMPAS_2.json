However, the Chi-Square test results suggest no significant deviation from an expected uniform distribution. Therefore, the overall bias level can be considered as Level 2 (Minimal Bias).\n4. **Visualizations:**\n   - [Gender Bar Chart](generated_files/gender_bar_chart.png)\n   - [Gender Pie Chart](generated_files/gender_pie_chart.png)\n5. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - Max/Min Ratio, Entropy, Gini, and Relative Risk analyses all indicate moderate bias.\n   - Chi-Square test results showed no significant deviation from a uniform distribution.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe analyses suggest that while there are some variations in the gender distribution, they are not severe enough to significantly impact the dataset's reliability. This results in an overall assessment of Minimal Bias (Level 2).\n\n### Report:\nYou can download and review the detailed report here: [Gender Bias Detection Report](generated_files/gender_bias_detection_report.pdf).\n\nIf you have any additional needs or other tasks, please let me know!",
