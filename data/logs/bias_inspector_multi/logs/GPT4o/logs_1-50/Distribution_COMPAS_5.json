We should ensure that the expected frequencies are sufficiently large to meet the test's assumptions.\n\n2. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: The uniform reference distribution may not be the most suitable for this feature. We could consider comparing the observed distribution against other reference distributions that better reflect the population's characteristics.\n\n3. **Jensen-Shannon Divergence**: This result indicates a moderate bias, which aligns with the possibility of underlying patterns that are not captured by a uniform distribution assumption. It might be beneficial to explore this further by visualizing the actual distribution.\n\n4. **Visualization**: It would be helpful to visualize the distribution of the \"Language\" feature using bar charts or pie charts. This can provide a more intuitive understanding of how the data is distributed and highlight any noticeable trends or patterns.\n\n5. **Additional Methods**: If necessary, we could consider additional methods from the references that were not initially selected, such as the Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to provide further insights.\n\n6. **Comprehensive Report**: Compile the findings into a detailed PDF report, including visualizations and interpretations of the results, to facilitate decision-making or further analysis.\n\nI recommend proceeding with visualizing the distribution and preparing a comprehensive report.
