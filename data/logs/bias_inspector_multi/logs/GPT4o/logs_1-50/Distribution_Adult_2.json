The \"Private\" work class is extremely overrepresented, leading to this extreme bias level.\n\n5. **Visualization:** A pie chart was successfully created to illustrate the distribution of \"workclass\".\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Level 5 (Extreme Bias):** According to my analysis and the tool results, the \"workclass\" feature in this dataset shows a very severe bias. For example, the max/min ratio calculated was 3242.29, and the adjusted Gini Index measured 0.56. These values indicate extreme bias, which may significantly affect the dataset’s reliability. I strongly recommend thoroughly considering the implications of this bias, and you may need to adjust the dataset to mitigate these effects.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional analysis, please let me know!
