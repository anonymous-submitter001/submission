Load the dataset and inspect the feature names to identify the custody status column.\n2. Clean any missing or invalid values in the custody status column to ensure accurate analysis.\n\n**Detection and Analysis Methods:**\n1. **Toolset Methods:**\n   - Use Shannon entropy and Balance metric to measure the uncertainty and evenness of the custody status distribution.\n   - Calculate the Gini Index to assess inequality in the distribution.\n   - Utilize the max/min ratio of categories to check for dominance in distribution.\n   - Analyze distribution using relative risk to capture deviations from uniform distribution.\n\n2. **Reference Literature:**\n   - Retrieve intentions from the reference literature and select an appropriate method with an ID ending digit greater than 5.\n\n**Visualization Approaches:**\n- Create visualizations such as bar charts or pie charts to easily observe the distribution of custody statuses.\n\n**Result Summarization:**\n- Summarize findings in terms of bias level, specifying whether the distribution is balanced or dominated by certain categories.\n\n### REASONS FOR CHOICE OF METHODS\n- **Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric**: Provides insight into how spread out the custody status categories are.\n- **Gini Index**: Offers a measure of inequality, useful for spotting dominant categories.\n- **Max/Min Ratio and Relative Risk**: Identifies dominant categories and their significance.\n\nI'll seek guidance from the Advisor Assistant to ensure the plan is comprehensive and effective.\n\nDECISION ANALYSIS",

The Max/Min Ratio and Relative Risk analyses indicate extreme dominance of certain categories, leading to a Level 5 bias. The Shannon Entropy, Balance Metric, and Gini Index also suggest significant inequality and uneven distribution. The Jensen-Shannon Divergence supports these findings with a moderate bias level.\n\nI'll now draft a comprehensive report summarizing these findings and the bias levels.

It's important to consistently use the predefined tiers (No Bias, Minimal Bias, Moderate Bias, Significant Bias, Extreme Bias) as you have done.\n   - Jensen-Shannon Divergence shows a moderate bias, while other methods indicate more significant biases.

The Max/Min Ratio and Relative Risk analyses highlight extreme dominance by certain categories, suggesting a Level 5 bias. Other methods, including Shannon Entropy, Balance Metric, and Gini Index, confirm significant inequality and unevenness in distribution. The Jensen-Shannon Divergence method identifies a moderate bias, adding depth to the analysis.\n\nThis bias may affect the reliability of analyses conducted using this feature, and careful consideration is recommended when interpreting results from the COMPAS dataset."

Here's a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n### Summary of Findings\n\n1. **Bias Type:** Distribution\n2. **Relevant Feature:** CustodyStatus\n\n3. **Bias Levels and Results:**\n   - **Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric:** Indicated a Level 4 Significant Bias with entropy and balance metrics showing uneven distribution.\n   - **Gini Index:** Also reflected a Level 4 Significant Bias, pointing to inequality in custody status distribution.\n   - **Max/Min Ratio and Relative Risk:** Both analyses showed a Level 5 Extreme Bias, highlighting extreme dominance of certain categories.\n   - **Jensen-Shannon Divergence:** Suggested a Level 3 Moderate Bias, providing an additional perspective on distribution imbalances.\n\n4. **Overall Bias Level:** After considering the results from multiple analyses, the overall bias level is assessed as Level 5 (Extreme Bias). The extreme values from Max/Min Ratio and Relative Risk primarily inform this conclusion, indicating significant skewness in the dataset.\n\n### Visualizations\n- **Bar Chart and Pie Chart:** These visualizations further illustrate the distribution of custody statuses, providing an intuitive understanding of category dominance.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe report concludes that there is a significant distribution bias in the \"CustodyStatus\" feature, with certain categories overwhelmingly represented. This bias could impact analyses relying on this feature, necessitating careful interpretation of results.\n\nI will now check with Advisor Assistant to ensure all aspects are covered and there are no further adjustments needed. \n\nDECISION ANALYSIS",
