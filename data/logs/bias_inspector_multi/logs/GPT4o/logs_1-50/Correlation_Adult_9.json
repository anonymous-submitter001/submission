The task is to determine if a person's native country impacts their income, specifically checking if individuals from certain countries are more likely to earn higher wages. The dataset is located at `source_files/Adult.csv`.\n\nHere's how we'll proceed:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dataset**: We'll start by loading the dataset and examining the features. This will help us identify the relevant columns for analysis. In this case, we're interested in the \"native country\" as a categorical feature and \"income\" as the outcome feature, which we'll likely treat as categorical for this analysis.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing**: We may need to clean the data, handle any missing values, and possibly standardize or normalize certain features to ensure accurate analysis.\n\n3. **Bias Detection and Analysis Methods**:\n   - We will perform correlation bias analysis between the categorical feature \"native country\" and the \"income\" feature. \n   - We'll explore different methods from the toolset, such as Cramér's V, Elift, and others to measure the correlation.\n   - Additionally, we'll review the reference literature to see if there are any specific methods that align well with this task.\n\n4. **Visualization**: Appropriate visualizations will be created to better understand the distribution and correlation between \"native country\" and \"income\".\n\n5. **Summarizing Results**: We'll categorize the level of bias detected, if any, and provide a detailed explanation of the findings.\n\nI'll now proceed to formulate a detailed plan and discuss it with the Advisor Assistant to ensure its completeness.

Given our task of examining the impact of native country on income, this test could be crucial.\n\n2. **Wasserstein-2 Distance**: This method can be effective in socioeconomic contexts, but I'm unsure about its applicability to categorical data without numerical transformation.\n\n3. **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)**: Although typically used for numerical data, its adaptation for categorical variables intrigues me, particularly in socio-economic contexts.\n\nCould you provide your insights on these methods and any recommendations for our analysis?",

Here are my thoughts and suggestions on each method:\n\n1. **Pearson's Chi-Square Test**: This is a classic statistical method for assessing the association between two categorical variables. Given the nature of your task—examining the relationship between 'native-country' and 'income'—this method is highly suitable. It provides a clear measure of whether there is a statistically significant association between the variables.\n\n2. **Wasserstein-2 Distance**: While this is a powerful method for measuring differences in distributions, it's typically more applicable to numerical data. For purely categorical analysis like yours, it may not be directly applicable unless the data is transformed in some way to fit the method's requirements.\n\n3. **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)**: This method is generally used for assessing statistical independence between pairs of variables, often in a multivariate setting. While it can be adapted for categorical variables, it may not offer additional advantages over the simpler and more interpretable Chi-Square Test for this specific task.\n\n### Recommendation:\n- I recommend using **Pearson's Chi-Square Test** as your primary method. It is well-suited for your analysis and directly applicable to your categorical variables.\n\nLet's proceed by retrieving the method details for Pearson's Chi-Square Test (ID: B-00-6) and then generating and executing the code to perform the analysis.",
