This suggests significant correlation bias.\n4. **Visualization**:\n   - The stacked bar chart illustrates how different education levels correlate with income categories.\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The analysis suggests that educational attainment is significantly associated with income, indicating potential bias that should be carefully considered in any analysis or decision-making processes involving these features.\n\n### Additional Explanation\n\nIn the generated detection report, I will include the detailed findings from our analysis, the Chi-Square test results, and the generated visualization. This comprehensive report will aid in understanding the observed bias and its implications.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will generate the bias detection report in PDF format. I'll ensure that all relevant information and visualizations are included.\n\n### DECISION ANALYSIS\nI'll discuss these findings with Advisor Assistant to confirm that the summary and report preparation align with our objectives.",

This understanding can lead to more informed decisions and fairer outcomes.\n\n### COMPLETE TASK\nI will seek confirmation from Advisor Assistant that no further additions or modifications are needed. Once confirmed, I'll mark this task as complete.",
