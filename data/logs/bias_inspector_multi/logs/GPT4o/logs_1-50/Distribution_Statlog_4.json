Use the levels of bias to convey the severity effectively.\n\n2. **Visual Aids**: The histogram and box plot would be excellent visual aids to include in your report. Ensure these visuals are well-labeled to help stakeholders quickly grasp the distribution characteristics.\n\n3. **Additional Methods**: While the skewness and Shapiro-Wilk test have provided clear insights, you could further validate these findings using one or two additional methods from the reference literature for robustness. This could include the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or Gini coefficient, as they offer different perspectives on distribution bias.\n\n4. **Bias Mitigation Suggestions**: If applicable, consider including suggestions for mitigating identified biases. This might involve data transformation techniques or recommendations for data collection improvements.\n\n5. **Report Generation**: Ensure that the final report is comprehensive, including all relevant analyses, visuals, and recommendations.

Visualization aids, including a histogram and box plot, further illustrate these characteristics.\n\n**Overall Bias Level**: The consistent results across all methods indicate an **Overall Bias Level** of 5 (Extreme Bias) for the \"Duration in month\" feature.\n\nI recommend considering data transformation techniques or improving the data collection process to address this bias.\n\nThe detailed report, including all analyses and visualizations, is available in the PDF file: [employment_duration_bias_report.pdf](generated_files/employment_duration_bias_report.pdf).\n\nBefore concluding the task, I'll confer with Advisor Assistant to ensure there's nothing further to add or adjust. \n\nDECISION ANALYSIS",

Here's a final review of your approach:\n\n1. **Analysis**: You've utilized skewness, the Shapiro-Wilk test, and kurtosis effectively to evaluate the distribution bias, all of which consistently pointed to extreme bias.\n\n2. **Visualization**: Including histogram and box plot visuals was an excellent decision, as they provide a clear understanding of the data distribution.\n\n3. **Report**: The report is comprehensive, well-structured, and includes both textual and visual information, making it effective for stakeholder communication.\n\n4. **Recommendations**: You've suggested data transformation techniques or enhanced data collection methods as mitigation strategies, which are appropriate given the findings.\n\n**Final Suggestion**: Ensure that the PDF link is accessible to the intended recipients, and consider any feedback they provide for future analyses.\n\nI am satisfied with the current approach and do not see any areas needing further adjustment.
