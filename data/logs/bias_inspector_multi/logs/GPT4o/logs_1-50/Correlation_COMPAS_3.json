The relevant columns for our analysis are \"Ethnic_Code_Text\" (representing ethnicity) and \"RecSupervisionLevelText\" (representing the recommended supervision levels).\n\n### Planned Method: Chi-Square Test\nThe Chi-Square test is appropriate for analyzing the correlation between two categorical variables. We will proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Construct a Contingency Table**: Create a table that shows the frequency distribution of the variables \"Ethnic_Code_Text\" and \"RecSupervisionLevelText\".\n2. **Calculate Expected Frequencies**: Use the formula to calculate the expected frequencies for each cell in the contingency table.\n3. **Compute the Chi-Square Statistic**: Use the formula for Chi-Square and compare it with the critical value to assess significance.\n4. **Automate Calculation with Python**: Use `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency()` to automate the calculation and obtain the Chi-Square statistic, p-value, and expected frequencies.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will write the Python code for executing the Chi-Square test using the method outlined in the reference literature and execute it to obtain the results.\n\nDECISION ANALYSIS",
