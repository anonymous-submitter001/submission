The task is to analyze whether the legal status of defendants is fairly distributed within the dataset provided at \"source_files/COMPAS.csv\". The goal is to detect any distribution bias or imbalance that might indicate bias.\n\nHere's the initial plan for executing this task:\n1. **Dataset Understanding and Preprocessing**:\n   - Load the dataset to understand its structure and identify the relevant feature for \"legal status.\"\n   - Clean any missing or invalid values in the relevant column to ensure accurate analysis.\n\n2. **Bias Detection Methods**:\n   - Since we are focusing on the distribution of a single categorical feature (legal status), we need to look for distribution bias analysis methods applicable to categorical data.\n   - We will select methods from both our toolset and reference literature to perform a comprehensive analysis.\n\n3. **Visualization**:\n   - Use appropriate visualization techniques to visualize the distribution of the legal status, such as bar charts or pie charts.\n\n4. **Result Summarization**:\n   - Summarize the findings in terms of bias type, relevant feature(s), and bias level.\n\nNow, let's discuss with Advisor Assistant to refine and validate this plan, especially focusing on the selection of detection methods.",

Make sure to identify the specific column related to \"legal status\" for targeted analysis.\n   - Consider normalizing or standardizing the data if needed to ensure consistency in analysis results.\n\n2. **Bias Detection Techniques**:\n   - Since we're analyzing a single categorical feature, focus on distribution bias analysis methods specifically designed for categorical data. For example, techniques like Shannon entropy, Gini Index, or Max/Min ratio can be useful.\n   - Ensure to retrieve and review reference methods with IDs greater than 5 as suggested in the task instruction. This is crucial for broadening the analysis with diverse methods.\n\n3. **Visualization**:\n   - Using bar charts or pie charts to visualize the distribution is appropriate. Consider using a treemap or heatmap for additional insights if you find it necessary.\n   - Make sure the visualizations clearly depict any imbalances in the distribution.\n\n4. **Result Summarization**:\n   - Clearly categorize and define the bias level based on the analysis results (e.g., No Bias, Minimal Bias, Moderate Bias, etc.).\n   - Prepare a detailed feedback report in PDF format, including both text and visual summaries.\n\nLastly, ensure to generate and execute the code after retrieving methods from references to perform the analysis. If you're ready with these refinements, let me know, and we can proceed with the task execution.",
