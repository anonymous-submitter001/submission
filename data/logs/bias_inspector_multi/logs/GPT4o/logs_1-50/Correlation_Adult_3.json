Good job in extracting the feature names to find the exact match. In future analyses, ensure that spaces or any special characters in column names are accounted for right from the start.\n\n2. **Bias Detection Techniques:**\n   - The choice of using Cramér's V, Elift, Statistical Parity, Lipschitz Function, and Total Variation Distance from the toolset was appropriate. These methods provide a comprehensive view of correlation bias between categorical features.\n   - The Chi-Square test from the reference literature is a classic method for examining categorical associations and was a suitable choice.\n   - The HSIC method encountered an error due to a code execution issue. Ensure that all dependencies and imports are correctly set up before execution.\n\n3. **Visualization Methods:**\n   - While analysis was conducted using statistical methods, visual aids such as bar charts or heatmaps can enhance understanding and should be considered for future tasks.\n\n4. **Format of the Summary Report:**\n   - Ensure that the final report contains insights from each method clearly, with a focus on explaining what each bias level means practically. Utilize the defined bias levels (No Bias, Minimal Bias, Moderate Bias, etc.) to maintain consistency.\n\n5. **Overall Plan and Execution:**\n   - The plan was comprehensive and well-executed, considering various methods to ensure robust analysis. Address the HSIC execution issue if possible and consider rerunning it.\n\n6. **Tool Selection and Usage:**\n   - The tools selected were appropriate for the task. Ensure all methods are executed without errors for complete analysis.\n\n7. **Feedback on Results:**\n   - The results indicated varying levels of bias between education and gender. Ensure the findings are communicated clearly, and any significant biases are highlighted with potential implications.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Address the HSIC execution error if feasible.\n- Prepare a detailed report summarizing the findings, including both statistical results and any visualizations.\n- Ensure clarity in presenting the significance of each bias level and its potential impact on the dataset.\n\nIf you follow these recommendations, you'll be able to provide a well-rounded analysis of the relationship between education levels and gender.",
