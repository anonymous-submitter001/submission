This ensures that the analysis is not skewed by data quality issues.\n\n### Bias Detection Method:\n- **Suggestion:** The Chi-Square test is appropriate for detecting distribution bias in categorical features. Ensure that the expected frequency for each category is not too low, as it may affect the validity of the Chi-Square test. Consider combining this method with others if the data characteristics suggest a need for additional insights.\n\n### Visualization:\n- **Suggestion:** Use both bar charts and pie charts for a comprehensive view of the distribution. This will help in visually assessing whether certain categories are over or underrepresented before diving into the statistical test results.\n\n### Result Summarization:\n- **Suggestion:** Clearly define the bias levels based on the Chi-Square test results. You may want to consider standard significance levels (e.g., p < 0.05) to determine whether the observed distribution significantly deviates from the expected distribution.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Code Execution:** Generate and execute the Python code for the Chi-Square test and visualization as planned. Ensure the code is robust and includes error handling for any potential issues (e.g., missing data, low expected frequencies).\n- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Consider including both text and visualization in a detailed PDF report for a holistic presentation of your findings.\n\nOnce you've addressed these suggestions, proceed with generating and executing the code for the analysis.

Here's a detailed summary of our findings:\n\n### Detailed Summary\n\n#### Bias Type: Distribution\n\n#### Relevant Feature(s): \n- Status of existing checking account\n\n#### Bias Level: Level 5 (Extreme Bias)\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n- **Chi-Square Statistic:** 226.57\n- **p-value:** \\(7.64 \\times 10^{-49}\\)\n\nThe Chi-Square test revealed a significant deviation from the expected uniform distribution, indicated by the extremely low p-value. This suggests an extreme bias, with certain account statuses being overrepresented or underrepresented.\n\n#### Visualization:\nThe pie chart provided a visual confirmation of the statistical findings, illustrating a clear imbalance in the representation of different checking account statuses.\n\n#### Additional Explanation:\nThe extreme bias detected in the \"Status of existing checking account\" feature may have significant implications for analyses or decision-making processes relying on this data. It's crucial to explore and address the underlying causes of this imbalance to ensure fairness and reliability.\n\n### Overall Bias Level: Level 5 (Extreme Bias)\n\nThis overall bias level is derived primarily from the Chi-Square test results and visual insights provided by the pie chart.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Investigate the causes of the imbalance in account statuses.\n- Consider data preprocessing or rebalancing techniques to mitigate the effects of this bias.\n- Use this insight to inform any analyses or decisions based on the dataset.\n\n### Report:\nThe detailed PDF report is available [here](sandbox:/generated_files/Status_checking_account_bias_report.pdf).\n\nI will now confirm with Advisor Assistant that there are no further additions or modifications needed before declaring the task complete. \n\n### DECISION ANALYSIS\n\n- **Confirmation Needed:** Ensure all aspects of the bias detection are comprehensively addressed in the report and summary.\n- **Further Modifications:** Are there any additional insights or elements you suggest including in our analysis or report before finalizing?\n\nLet's finalize our findings and conclusions with this discussion!",
