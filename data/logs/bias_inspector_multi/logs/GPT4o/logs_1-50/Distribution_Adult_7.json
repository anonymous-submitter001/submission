For this, I will review the available tools and reference literature to find the most suitable methods for this analysis.\n\n### Initial Plan\n1. **Understanding the Data**: \n   - Identify the relevant feature for analysis, which is \"race\" in this case.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**:\n   - Check for missing values in the \"race\" column and clean them if necessary.\n\n3. **Detection and Analysis Methods**:\n   - Use the following methods from the toolset to analyze the distribution bias:\n     - **Shannon Entropy and Balance**: To measure the uncertainty of the distribution.\n     - **Max/Min Ratio**: To evaluate the dominance of any particular category.\n     - **Entropy**: To understand the information content of the distribution.\n     - **Gini Index**: To assess the inequality in the distribution.\n     - **Relative Risk**: To compare observed and expected frequencies.\n\n4. **Visualization**:\n   - Use a pie chart to visually represent the proportion of each racial group.\n\n5. **Result Summarization**:\n   - Summarize the findings based on the results from each method and categorize the bias level.\n\nNow, I will consult with the Advisor Assistant to see if there are any additional suggestions or modifications needed for this plan.",
