Here is a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n1. **Objective:** Analyze the correlation between attending extra paid classes and final grades to determine any correlation bias.\n2. **Bias Type:** Correlation\n3. **Relevant Features:** `paid` (categorical), `G3` (numerical)\n4. **Overall Bias Level:** Level 2 (Minimal Bias)\n   - **HSIC Value:** \\(6.9311 \\times 10^{-7}\\) - weak correlation\n   - **Max Absolute N Value:** \\(0.1109\\) - minimal bias\n   - **Cohen's d Effect Size:** \\(0.2078\\) - minimal bias\n   - **Standardized Difference:** \\(-0.1431\\) - minimal bias\n\n### Additional Explanation:\nThe analysis suggests that attending extra paid classes has only a minimal impact on final grades. The metrics from various tools consistently show slight variations, confirming the weak correlation observed. The box plot visualization aligns with these findings, showing a similar distribution of grades regardless of paid class attendance.\n\n### Report:\nThe detailed report has been created and can be accessed here: [Bias Detection Report](generated_files/Bias_Detection_Report_Paid_Classes_vs_Grades.pdf).\n\n### Next Steps:\nPlease review the report and let me know if there are any further questions or additional analyses you would like to explore. If there's anything else I can assist with, feel free to ask!\n\nCOMPLETE TASK",
