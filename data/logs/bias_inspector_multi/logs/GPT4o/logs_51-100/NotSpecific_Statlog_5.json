Let's break down the results:\n\n1. **Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric**: \n   - **Balance Metric**: 0.9739\n   - **Interpretation**: The balance metric is very close to 1, indicating a nearly uniform distribution. According to the bias level thresholds, this corresponds to **Level 1 (No Bias)**.\n\n2. **Max/Min Ratio**:\n   - **Max/Min Ratio**: 2.1558\n   - **Interpretation**: This ratio is slightly above 2, which corresponds to **Level 2 (Minimal Bias)**.\n\n3. **Jensen-Shannon Divergence**:\n   - **JSD Value**: 0.0093\n   - **Interpretation**: A very low JSD value, indicating a distribution very close to uniform, which also suggests **Level 1 (No Bias)**.\n\n### Overall Bias Level\nBased on the results from the multiple tools used, the overall bias level for the \"Property\" feature is **Level 1 (No Bias)**. The tools consistently show metrics that point to a near-uniform distribution with minimal variations.\n\n### Detailed Summary and Explanation\n**Bias Type**: Distribution\n**Relevant Feature**: Property\n**Bias Level**: Level 1 (No Bias)\n\nThe detailed analysis using Shannon Entropy, Max/Min Ratio, and Jensen-Shannon Divergence provides strong evidence that the \"Property\" feature in this dataset is very well balanced with minimal bias. This is supported by the high balance metric, a reasonable max/min ratio, and a very low Jensen-Shannon Divergence, all of which indicate a distribution close to uniform.\n\nI'll now prepare a PDF report summarizing these findings. Let's confirm with Advisor Assistant if there are any additional insights or modifications needed.",
