For categorical-categorical, use Cramér's V or Elift; for categorical-numerical, use Cohen's d or standardized difference.\n\n3. **Visualization Methods:**\n   - Use bar charts or pie charts for visualizing the distribution of the \"Housing\" feature.\n   - Use correlation heatmaps or grouped bar charts for exploring relationships with other features.\n\n4. **Reference Literature:**\n   - Review the reference articles to choose the most suitable methods, ensuring to select a reference number greater than 5.\n   - Generate and execute code based on the chosen methods.\n\n5. **Summary Report:**\n   - Prepare a detailed report summarizing the findings, including the bias type, relevant features, bias level, and visualizations.\n\nOnce the above steps are finalized, proceed with the analysis.

This visualization will help illustrate the distribution of housing categories within the dataset.\n\nLet's move forward with generating the detection report, summarizing all findings, and including the pie chart. I'll ensure that the report clearly articulates the bias levels identified through our analyses.\n\n**Summary for the Report:**\n1. **Bias Type:** Distribution\n2. **Relevant Feature(s):** Housing\n3. **Bias Level:** Moderate Bias (Level 3) for distribution, No Bias (Level 1) for correlation.\n4. **Additional Explanation:** \n   - The \"Housing\" feature shows moderate distribution bias, particularly in the prevalence of the \"own\" category over \"rent\" and \"for free.\" \n   - The correlation analysis between \"Housing\" and \"Credit amount\" yielded no significant bias, indicating that housing circumstances do not strongly correlate with credit amounts in this dataset.\n\nLet's finalize these details and confirm with the Advisor Assistant. Once confirmed, I will generate the report. \n\nDECISION ANALYSIS",
