Your task is to determine if ForeignWorkers tend to have worse credit histories, using the dataset located at `source_files/Statlog.csv`. This involves assessing the correlation between the \"ForeignWorkers\" feature and the \"CreditHistory\" feature to identify any bias.\n\nLet's proceed with creating an overall plan for this task, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dataset**:\n   - Load the dataset and identify the features.\n   - Extract the relevant columns: \"ForeignWorkers\" and \"CreditHistory\".\n\n2. **Preprocessing**:\n   - Check for missing or invalid values in the selected columns and clean the data if necessary.\n\n3. **Bias Detection and Analysis**:\n   - Since both \"ForeignWorkers\" and \"CreditHistory\" are likely categorical variables, we can use correlation analysis methods designed for categorical data.\n\n4. **Method Selection**:\n   - Review available tools and reference literature to select the most appropriate methods for correlation analysis between these categorical features.\n\n5. **Visualization**:\n   - Visualize the distribution and correlation using appropriate charts, such as stacked bar charts or grouped bar charts.\n\n6. **Result Summarization**:\n   - Summarize the findings, categorize the bias level, and provide a detailed explanation.\n\nBefore we proceed with selecting the methods, let's consult with Advisor Assistant to ensure our plan is comprehensive and suitable for this task.",
