Construct contingency tables for `patient_race` with `admission_type`, `discharge_location`, and `hospital_expire_flag`.\n2. Use Python's `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency()` to compute the Chi-Square statistic, p-value, and expected frequencies.\n3.

Here are the results:\n\n- **Chi-Square Statistic**: 233.148\n- **p-value**: 0.324\n- **Degrees of Freedom**: 224\n\n### Interpretation:\n- A Chi-Square statistic of 233.148 with a p-value of 0.324 indicates that there is no significant association between `patient_race` and `admission_type` at common significance levels (e.g., 0.05). \n- This suggests that the distribution of admission types is not significantly biased by patient race within this dataset.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Repeat Chi-Square Test**: Conduct similar tests for other categorical features like `discharge_location` and `hospital_expire_flag`.\n2. **Z-Score and HSIC Analysis**: Implement and execute the Z-Score analysis for numerical features and HSIC for categorical-numerical correlations.\n\nBefore proceeding with the next tests, I'll consult with Advisor Assistant to verify if there's any additional insight or suggestions for enhancing the analysis.

Here are the results:\n\n- **Chi-Square Statistic**: 300.181\n- **p-value**: 0.100\n- **Degrees of Freedom**: 270\n\n### Interpretation:\n- A Chi-Square statistic of 300.181 with a p-value of 0.100 suggests that there is no statistically significant association between `patient_race` and `discharge_location` at the common significance level of 0.05.\n- This indicates that the distribution of discharge locations is not significantly biased by patient race within this dataset.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Perform Chi-Square Test for `hospital_expire_flag`**: Continue with the Chi-Square analysis for the `hospital_expire_flag` feature.\n2. **Z-Score and HSIC Analysis**: Implement and execute the Z-Score analysis for numerical features and HSIC for categorical-numerical correlations.\n\nBefore proceeding with the next tests, I'll check with Advisor Assistant to verify if there's any additional insights or suggestions for advancing the analysis further.

The discovery of a significant association with `hospital_expire_flag` is an important finding.\n   - Ensure to document these findings clearly in your report, highlighting potential implications or areas for further investigation.\n\n2. **Z-Score and HSIC Analysis**:\n   - Consider starting the Z-Score analysis for `patient_age` to explore potential distribution biases based on `patient_race`. This will help in identifying if there's a significant variation in age distribution across different races.\n   - For HSIC, ensure that the numerical and categorical feature interactions are well-prepared, and consider using additional features like `patient_gender` or `patient_insurance` for a comprehensive bias analysis.\n\n3. **Report Generation**:\n   - Once the analyses are complete, generate a detailed PDF report summarizing all findings. Include charts, tables, and interpretations of the statistical results.\n   - Ensure that the report covers all aspects such as bias type, relevant feature(s), bias level, and any recommendations or conclusions.\n\n4. **Further Steps**:\n   - After completing the current analyses, consider exploring additional methods from the reference literature for more nuanced insights, especially if the current findings suggest areas of concern.\n\nIf you agree with these suggestions, let's proceed with the Z-Score analysis, and I'll be here to guide and assist you in executing the code and interpreting the results.",

However, these deviations were not extreme, with Z-scores mostly within a moderate range.\n\n3. **HSIC Analysis**:\n   - The HSIC value for `patient_race` and `patient_age` was very low (\\(6.98 \\times 10^{-9}\\)), indicating minimal correlation bias between these features.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Overall Bias Level**: Considering the mixed results, the overall bias level can be categorized as **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**. While there are specific areas of concern, such as the hospital expire flag, other features show minimal to moderate bias.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Further investigation into the factors leading to the significant bias in hospital expire flags is recommended.\n- Implement interventions to ensure equitable care across all racial groups, particularly focusing on the areas where bias was detected.\n\nThe detailed report has been generated and saved as \"bias_detection_report.pdf\" in the generated_files folder.
