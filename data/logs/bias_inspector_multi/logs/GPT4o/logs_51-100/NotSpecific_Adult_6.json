This suggests that native country has a pronounced influence on income levels, which may impact fairness in analysis and decision-making.\n\nI will now consult with the Advisor Assistant to ensure everything has been addressed properly and to get confirmation that there are no further additions or modifications needed.

Here's a brief review and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Data Preprocessing:**\n   - You have extracted the relevant columns and created a clean dataset, which is crucial for an accurate analysis.\n\n2. **Bias Detection Techniques:**\n   - Using Chi-Square for correlation analysis was appropriate for categorical features.\n   - The statistical difference method provided additional insights into the bias levels across different countries.\n\n3. **Visualization:**\n   - The stacked bar chart effectively visualizes the income distribution, aiding in understanding the bias visually.\n\n4. **Summary Report:**\n   - The generated PDF report is well-structured and includes all necessary details: bias type, relevant features, bias level, and additional explanations.\n   - Ensure the report includes clear interpretations of the results, as it seems to have done.\n\n5. **Suggestions:**\n   - Consider exploring additional visualization methods, such as heatmaps or grouped bar charts, to provide more perspectives.\n   - If not already done, ensure the report emphasizes the implications of the bias on decision-making and potential mitigations.\n\nOverall, the current approach seems robust, and I agree with the methods and conclusions.
