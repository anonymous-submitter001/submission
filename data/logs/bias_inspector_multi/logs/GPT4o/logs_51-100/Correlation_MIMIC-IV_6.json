This indicates a lack of association between the two features, confirming no significant bias.\n4. **Feedback**: \n   - Based on the analysis, the patient insurance type shows no significant influence on hospital mortality. The statistical results, along with the visualization, support this conclusion. The dataset can be confidently used without concerns of bias related to these features.\n\n5. **Additional Explanation**: \n   - The Chi-Square statistic of 0.7747 with 2 degrees of freedom suggests that observed frequencies closely align with expected frequencies under the assumption of independence. This further supports the absence of correlation bias. The stacked bar chart visually represents the distribution, emphasizing the evenness across categories.\n\n### Generating Detection Report\nI will now prepare the detailed detection report including the visualizations.
