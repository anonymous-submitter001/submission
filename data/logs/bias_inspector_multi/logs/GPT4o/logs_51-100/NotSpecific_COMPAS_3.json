This suggests a Level 3 bias according to the skewness evaluation criteria (0.8 <= Absolute Skewness < 0.9).\n\n2. **Kurtosis**:\n   - Value: -1.039\n   - Interpretation: A kurtosis value of -1.039 indicates that the distribution is more flat than a normal distribution. This places it in Level 5 bias according to the kurtosis evaluation criteria (Absolute Kurtosis >= 1.2).\n\n3. **Outlier Percentage**:\n   - Value: 0.0%\n   - Interpretation: The absence of outliers in the dataset suggests a Level 1 bias according to the outlier evaluation criteria (Outlier Percentage < 0.5%).\n\n4. **Cohen's d using MAD**:\n   - Value: -2.287\n   - Interpretation: A Cohen's d value of -2.287 indicates a significant effect size, placing it in Level 5 bias according to the Cohen's d evaluation criteria (Absolute Cohen's d >= 0.4).\n\n5. **Quantile Deviation**:\n   - Value: 0.085\n   - Interpretation: This value indicates a Level 1 bias according to the quantile deviation criteria (Absolute Quantile Deviation < 0.50).\n\n### DECISION ANALYSIS\n\nBased on the analysis, I will summarize the findings for the user. The bias levels range from Level 1 to Level 5, with the majority showing significant bias. I will consult with Advisor Assistant to determine if any additional methods should be included or if the current findings are sufficient to conclude the task.

The tools I used indicate varying levels of bias across different metrics:\n- **Skewness** is moderately skewed, indicating some bias (Level 3).\n- **Kurtosis** suggests a flatter distribution than normal, which is quite severe (Level 5).\n- **Cohen's d** shows a significant effect size (Level 5).\n- No outliers were detected, indicating minimal bias in this regard (Level 1).\n- **Quantile Deviation** also indicates minimal bias (Level 1).\n\nThese results suggest that the age information in this dataset may impact analyses and interpretations significantly. I recommend a cautious assessment of the potential effects before using this dataset.\n\n### Report\n\nI have generated a detailed PDF report summarizing all findings, and you can download it from the following location: [Bias Detection Report for Age in COMPAS Dataset](sandbox:/mnt/data/generated_files/Bias_Detection_Report_AGE_COMPAS.pdf).\n\nWould you like any further assistance or additional analysis?",
