This suggests a Level 1 bias category (No Bias).\n\n### Analysis and Summary:\n\n- **Bias Type:** Correlation\n- **Relevant Features:** Age in years, Credit risk (Good/Bad)\n- **Cohen's d Bias Level:** Level 2 (Minimal Bias)\n- **HSIC Bias Level:** Level 1 (No Bias)\n\n**Overall Bias Level:** Considering the results from both methods, the overall bias level can be categorized as Level 1 (No Bias).\n\n- **Feedback to User:** Based on my analysis, it appears that the age and credit risk features in this dataset show no significant bias. The results from the methods I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state.
