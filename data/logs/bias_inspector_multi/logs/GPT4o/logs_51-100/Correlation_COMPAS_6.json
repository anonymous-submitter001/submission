This suggests that there is no significant correlation bias between the age categories derived from the birth dates and the decile scores in the dataset.\n\n### Summary of the Detection Task:\n1. **Bias Type**: Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features**: DateOfBirth (converted to Age) and DecileScore\n3. **Bias Level**: Level 1 (No Bias)\n   - Based on the HSIC value, which is extremely close to zero, indicating no notable correlation bias.\n   \n### Explanation to User:\n- **Level 1 (No Bias)**: Based on my analysis, it appears that the age categories derived from birth dates and the decile scores in this dataset show no significant bias. The HSIC analysis, a measure of dependency between variables, returned a value of \\(3.3933888322860242 \\times 10^{-12}\\), which is remarkably low. This implies that the distribution of decile scores does not significantly correlate with different age groups. You can confidently proceed with using this dataset without worrying about age-related scoring biases.\n\n### Visualization Plan:\n- To better illustrate the findings, I will plot a bar chart or box plot to visually confirm the distribution of decile scores across different age groups.\n\nI'll now consult with Advisor Assistant regarding this summary and visualization plan.",
