For example, if a treatment plan feature is numerical, we might use methods like Cohen's d, Standardized Difference, or Causal Effect. If it is categorical, methods like Cramér's V or Elift could be more appropriate.\n   \n3. **Visualization**:\n   - Create visualizations to illustrate the distribution of treatment plans across different genders and the correlation between gender and treatment plans.\n\n4. **Result Summarization and Reporting**:\n   - Summarize the findings with details on bias type, relevant features, and bias level.\n   - Generate a detailed detection report.\n\nI'll now reach out to Advisor Assistant to get its suggestions on the proposed plan, especially regarding the selection of bias detection and analysis methods. \n\nDECISION ANALYSIS",

This suggests potential gender-related differences in treatment plans or outcomes.\n   - Risk Difference analysis showed that age-related outcomes are not significantly biased by gender, as the Risk Difference was minimal.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The dataset exhibits varying levels of bias, with the most extreme being related to marital status. These biases should be considered in analyses involving gender-based treatment plans.\n\nI recommend reviewing the generated report for a comprehensive understanding.
