Now, let's summarize the findings and compile the report.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type**: Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features**: 'reason' and 'Medu'\n3. **Chi-Square Test**:\n   - **Chi-Square Statistic**: 13.826\n   - **P-value**: 0.312\n   - **Conclusion**: No significant correlation was found, indicating no bias.\n4. **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)**:\n   - **HSIC Value**: \\(7.80 \\times 10^{-10}\\)\n   - **Conclusion**: The near-zero value confirms the absence of correlation bias.\n5. **Bias Level**: Level 1 (No Bias)\n   - The results from both the Chi-Square test and HSIC analysis consistently indicate no bias.\n6. **Visualizations**:\n   - **Stacked Bar Chart**: Visualizes the distribution of school choice reasons across different maternal education levels.\n   - **Grouped Bar Chart**: Provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between 'reason' and 'Medu'.\n\n### Additional Explanation:\nThe analysis demonstrates that mother's education level does not significantly influence the reason students choose their school. This conclusion is supported by both statistical tests and visualizations, providing confidence in the dataset's neutrality regarding this aspect.\n\nI will now generate the PDF report including these findings and visualizations.",
