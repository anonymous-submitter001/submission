These metrics suggest the occupation feature is relatively well-distributed, indicating a Level 2 (Minimal Bias).\n   - **Gini Index**:\n     - The Adjusted Gini Index is 0.967, which indicates no inequality and translates to Level 1 (No Bias).\n   - **Chi-Square Test**:\n     - With a Chi-Square Value of 8786.32 and a P-Value of 0.0, there is a significant deviation from a uniform distribution, suggesting a Level 5 (Extreme Bias) due to the non-uniform distribution of occupations.\n\n4. **Overall Bias Level**: Considering the results from different analyses, the overall bias level is determined to be Level 3 (Moderate Bias). This suggests that while some metrics indicate minimal or no bias, the significant Chi-Square test result highlights potential concerns in the distribution.\n\n5. **Visualizations**:\n   - Bar Chart and Pie Chart provide visual insights into the distribution of the occupation feature. (Images are included in the report.)\n\nThe generated PDF report provides a comprehensive overview of these findings. You can download it [here](sandbox:/generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf).\n\nI will now discuss these findings with the Advisor Assistant to ensure completeness and accuracy.",
