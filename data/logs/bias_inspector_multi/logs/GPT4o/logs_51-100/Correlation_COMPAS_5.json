The box plot visually supports these findings, showing variations in decile scores between the two consolidated age groups. This bias could potentially affect decisions based on age-related decile scores, and it may be advisable to consider this in related assessments or policy-making.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional analysis, please feel free to let me know.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK",
