This method is suitable for detecting correlation bias between a categorical feature and a numerical feature, using matrix operations and one-hot encoding.\n\n3. **Visualization:**\n    - **Box Plot:** Visualize the distribution of `RawScore` across different language groups using a box plot.\n\n4. **Result Summarization:**\n    - **Bias Level and Explanation:** Summarize the findings in terms of bias levels and provide a detailed explanation.\n\nLet's start by extracting and cleaning the necessary columns from the dataset.",

Here's a refined approach to address this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Matrix Dimensions**: The empirical cross-covariance matrix calculation should consider that `X_standardized` is a 1D array, and `Y_encoded` is a 2D matrix. When performing the dot product, ensure that the dimensions align by transposing the correct matrix.\n\n2. **Check Methodology Steps**: Verify that the steps from the reference are correctly translated into code, especially focusing on matrix operations. If the reference steps are misinterpreted, the calculations will fail.\n\nHere's a suggestion to adjust the code:\n\n- When computing `Cxy`, ensure that the dimensions of `X_standardized` and `Y_encoded` are correctly aligned for matrix multiplication. This typically involves ensuring that `X_standardized` is reshaped correctly and that `Y_encoded` is transposed if necessary.\n\n- Double-check the matrix operation logic to ensure the correct orientation of matrices for the dot product.\n\nWould you like to adjust the code to reflect these suggestions or explore an alternative method?",

This conclusion is supported by both numerical analysis and visualization.\n\nI will now seek confirmation from Advisor Assistant to ensure there's nothing further to adjust or add before we declare the task complete.\n\n### DECISION ANALYSIS\n\nAdvisor Assistant, I've completed the analysis and generated the report. The overall bias level is categorized as Level 1 (No Bias). Please review the findings and let me know if there's anything else to modify or add.",
