The file paths might need to be adjusted depending on the environment's configuration.\n\n2. **Simplified Code Segment**: Test a minimalistic code snippet to verify basic data loading functionality. For example:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   try:\n       data = pd.read_csv('generated_files/higher_education_dataset.csv')\n       print(\"Data loaded successfully\")\n       print(data.head())\n   except Exception as e:\n       print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n   ```\n   This snippet isolates the data loading step to confirm whether the dataset is accessible, without additional computations.\n\n3. **Confirm File Existence**: Verify that the `generated_files/higher_education_dataset.csv` file exists in the expected directory and is not corrupted.\n\nBy addressing these points, you can pinpoint the root cause of the error.
