Primary Assistant successfully selected the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) method to evaluate correlation bias between categorical and numerical features, which was appropriate for this context.\n\n2. **Plan Evaluation**:\n   - The detection plan was well-structured, including data preprocessing, bias detection, visualization, and summarization. Primary Assistant ensured to review both the reference literature and tools available before proceeding.\n\n3. **Tool Selection and Usage**:\n   - Primary Assistant chose the appropriate tools for the task, utilizing the function to execute code for HSIC calculation and generating visualizations to support the findings.\n\n4. **Feedback on Results**:\n   - The results were clearly presented, with a detailed explanation of the bias level, relevant features, and the absence of significant correlation bias. The generated report was comprehensive and aligned with the analysis conducted.\n\nOverall, the approach was sound, and the task was executed effectively.
