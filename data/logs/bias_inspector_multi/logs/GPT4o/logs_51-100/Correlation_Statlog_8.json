I can help you identify potential bias in your data, whether it's related to correlation between features or distribution within a single feature.\n\nHere's how we can work together:\n\n1. **Define the Detection Task:** We can start by clearly defining what kind of bias detection you are interested in. For example, are you looking to understand the correlation between two features, or are you interested in the distribution of a single feature?\n\n2. **Select the Dataset:** Once we have a clear task, we need to choose the dataset that we'll be analyzing.\n\n3. **Plan the Analysis:** I'll formulate a comprehensive plan for executing the task, including methods for data preprocessing, bias detection, analysis, visualization, and result summarization. I'll also consider methods from reference literature to ensure a thorough analysis.\n\n4. **Execute the Plan:** Using the appropriate tools and methods, I'll perform the analysis and visualize the results.\n\n5. **Summarize the Findings:** I'll provide you with a detailed summary of the conclusions, including the type of bias, relevant features, and bias level.

Let's choose some appropriate references for correlation bias between categorical features.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Data Understanding & Preprocessing**: Ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis.\n2. **Bias Detection**:\n   - Use the selected toolset methods to analyze correlation bias.\n   - Retrieve additional methods from the reference literature for comprehensive analysis.\n3. **Visualization**: Use appropriate visualization techniques to illustrate the findings.\n4. **Result Summarization**: Summarize the results, including bias type, relevant features, and bias level.\n\nLet me now discuss these points with Advisor Assistant to refine our approach and ensure completeness.",

It suggests that the numerical feature is not varying across categories.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- Based on the **Max Absolute Mean** and **Cohen's d**, both results suggest that there is no noticeable correlation between the number of dependents and credit risk.\n- The **Standardized Difference** result indicates that there might be no variance in the numerical feature across the groups, which aligns with the other methods' findings of no bias.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to further inspect the data distribution and correlations.\n2. **Summarization**: Compile all insights into a detailed summary and report.\n\nI'll consult with Advisor Assistant to finalize the plan for visualization and report generation, ensuring a comprehensive conclusion.",
