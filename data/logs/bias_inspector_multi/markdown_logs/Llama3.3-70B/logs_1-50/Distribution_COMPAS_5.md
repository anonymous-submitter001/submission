### Message Content:

DECISION ANALYSIS 

Based on the results from the Chi-Square test and the max/min ratio analysis, it appears that there is a significant correlation between the Language feature and other features in the dataset, as well as distribution bias in some numerical features. 

The Chi-Square test revealed a significant deviation from the expected distribution for the Language feature, indicating potential correlation bias. 

The max/min ratio analysis detected extreme bias in several numerical features, including Person_ID, AssessmentID, Case_ID, ScaleSet_ID, RecSupervisionLevel, Scale_ID, RawScore, DecileScore, IsCompleted, and IsDeleted. 

These findings suggest that the dataset may contain biases that could impact the accuracy of analysis or models built using this data. 

To further investigate these biases and their potential impact, additional analysis and visualization techniques may be necessary. 

What would you like to do next?

COMPLETE TASK.

Based on the results from the Chi-Square test and the max/min ratio analysis, it appears that there is a significant correlation between the Language feature and other features in the dataset, as well as distribution bias in some numerical features.

The Chi-Square test revealed a significant deviation from the expected distribution for the Language feature, indicating potential correlation bias.

The max/min ratio analysis detected extreme bias in several numerical features, including Person_ID, AssessmentID, Case_ID, ScaleSet_ID, RecSupervisionLevel, Scale_ID, RawScore, DecileScore, IsCompleted, and IsDeleted.

The Shannon entropy and balance metric for the Language feature are 0.0387475501981076 and 0.0387475501981076 respectively.

Bias Type: Distribution
Relevant Feature(s): Language
Bias Level: Level 5

The bias level is categorized as Level 5, indicating extreme bias in the Language feature.

Additional Explanation: The extreme bias detected in the Language feature and several numerical features suggests that the dataset may contain significant biases that could impact the accuracy of analysis or models built using this data. Further investigation and mitigation strategies may be necessary to address these biases.

Do you have any other tasks or questions?
