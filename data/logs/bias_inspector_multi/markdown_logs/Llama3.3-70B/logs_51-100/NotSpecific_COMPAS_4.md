DECISION ANALYSIS

Based on the provided dataset, "source_files/COMPAS.csv", and the intention to detect bias, I will select a few relevant references from the list. 

For correlation bias between two categorical features, I choose reference 'B-00-6' because it uses Pearson's Chi-square test, which is suitable for detecting correlation bias between categorical variables.

For correlation bias between a categorical feature and a numerical feature, I choose reference 'B-01-4' as it uses causal Bayesian network method, which can effectively model the relationships between categorical and numerical variables.

For distribution bias in a numerical feature, I choose reference 'A-1-6' because it uses the max/min ratio of relative frequencies in bins, which can help identify distribution bias in numerical features.

Next, I will use the get_reference_method_by_id tool to obtain the methods for these references. 

Then, I will discuss the plan with Advisor Assistant to ensure its completeness and effectiveness. 

After that, I will execute the task by invoking the corresponding tools from the toolset or writing code to implement the methods obtained from the references. 

Finally, I will provide a detailed summary of the conclusions based on the results obtained from each method and generate a detection report using the generate_bias_report_pdf tool. 

Please wait for my next response after I have discussed the plan with Advisor Assistant.

DECISION ANALYSIS

Based on the results from the Pearson's Chi-square test, the Chi-square statistic is 219.46146048553624 and the p-value is 5.003909982755062e-43, which is less than the significance level of 0.05. This indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis of independence and conclude that there is a significant correlation bias between the 'Sex_Code_Text' and 'Ethnic_Code_Text' features in the COMPAS dataset.

Next, I will use the get_reference_method_by_id tool to obtain the method for reference 'B-01-4' to detect correlation bias between a categorical feature and a numerical feature.

Then, I will discuss the plan with Advisor Assistant to ensure its completeness and effectiveness.

After that, I will execute the task by invoking the corresponding tools from the toolset or writing code to implement the methods obtained from the references.
