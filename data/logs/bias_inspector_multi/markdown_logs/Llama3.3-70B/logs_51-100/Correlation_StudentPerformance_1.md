### Message Content:

DECISION ANALYSIS I understand that you want to investigate if there's a link between where students live (urban or rural) and their final grades. The dataset for this analysis is located at source_files/Student Performance.csv. To begin, I'll need to examine the dataset and determine the best approach for detecting and analyzing this potential correlation. 

Next, I will call the get_all_reference_intentions tool to review the available reference literature and find relevant methods for correlation detection and analysis. 

Then, I'll discuss the plan with Advisor Assistant to ensure it's comprehensive and suitable for the task. 

After that, I'll select the appropriate tools from the toolset and reference literature to execute the detection and analysis tasks. 

Finally, I'll provide a detailed summary of the findings, including the bias type, relevant features, bias level, and additional explanations, and generate a detection report using the generate_bias_report_pdf tool. 

I'll also need to communicate with Advisor Assistant throughout the process to ensure the plan is on track and make any necessary adjustments. 

Let me start by calling the get_all_reference_intentions tool to review the available reference literature.

### Message Content:

COMPLETE TASK. 

The overall bias level is Level 3. 

Based on the results from the tools used, there is a significant association between the 'address' and 'G3' features. The bias level was evaluated based on the effect size. A larger effect size suggests a stronger bias between the categorical and numerical features.

Do you have any additional needs or other tasks to be done?
