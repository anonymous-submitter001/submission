### Message Content:

Thank you for providing the details. It looks like you want to determine if there's any correlation or bias linked to an individual's native country in the dataset located at `source_files/Adult.csv`. This task involves checking how the feature "native country" might be influencing other outcomes or variables in the dataset.

To proceed, I'll first need to review the dataset's structure, focusing on the "native country" feature and any other relevant features that might be influenced by it. After that, I will develop a comprehensive plan for bias detection and analysis, including selecting appropriate methods and tools.

Before I move forward, I'll seek guidance from the Advisor Assistant to ensure our approach is aligned. Let's start with understanding the dataset's features.

### Message Content:

The dataset features have been successfully retrieved. Here are the features present in the dataset:

- age
- workclass
- fnlwgt
- education
- education-num
- marital-status
- occupation
- relationship
- race
- sex
- capital-gain
- capital-loss
- hours-per-week
- native-country
- income

Since your focus is on determining if there's any bias or influence linked to the "native-country" feature, we'll investigate how this feature might correlate with the "income" feature, as income could potentially be influenced by an individual's native country.

### Plan Formulation:
1. **Understanding and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset and inspect the "native-country" and "income" features.
   - Clean any missing or invalid values in these features.
   
2. **Bias Detection and Analysis:**
   - Since both "native-country" and "income" are categorical, we can use correlation analysis methods for categorical data.
   - Consider tools like Cramér's V, Elift, and Statistical Parity to analyze the correlation between these two features.
   
3. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the distribution of the "native-country" feature and its relation to "income" using bar charts or stacked bar charts.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings, specifying the bias type, relevant features, and bias level.
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the results.

Next, I need to consult with the Advisor Assistant to ensure this plan is comprehensive and aligned with best practices. Let's discuss this plan step by step!

### Message Content:

We have a comprehensive list of intentions from the reference literature. Since the task is to detect potential bias linked to the "native-country" feature and its influence on the "income" feature, both of which are categorical, I'll focus on relevant references regarding correlation bias between categorical features.

Here are some relevant references from the list:
- **B-00-7**: Detect whether there is correlation bias between two categorical features using Chi-Square test within the fairness domain.
- **B-00-8**: Detect whether there is correlation bias between two categorical features using statistical analysis within healthcare demographic data.
- **B-00-9**: Detect whether there is correlation bias between two categorical features using statistical disparity ratio within the social domain.
  
I'll retrieve the methods for these references, focusing first on those that align with categorical correlation analysis, such as Chi-Square and statistical analysis methods. Let me consult with Advisor Assistant on this approach to ensure I'm on the right track.

### Message Content:

The Chi-Square test has been executed successfully and here are the results:

- **Chi-Square Statistic**: 317.230
- **p-value**: 2.211e-44
- **Degrees of Freedom**: 41

The p-value is extremely low, indicating that there is a statistically significant association between the "native-country" and "income" features. This suggests potential bias or influence of the native country on income levels.

### Next Steps:
Now, I will proceed to implement the method from the second reference (B-00-8) to further analyze the statistical differences between groups. Before executing, I'll discuss with Advisor Assistant to ensure our approach is complete and accurate.

Let's move forward with coding for statistical analysis based on the second reference.

### Message Content:

The stacked bar chart visualization has been successfully created to illustrate the distribution of income levels across different native countries. This will help in visually understanding the influence of "native-country" on "income."

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** native-country, income
3. **Bias Level:** 
   - The Chi-Square test showed a significant association with a very low p-value, indicating a correlation.
   - The statistical analysis of differences in proportions between income groups further highlights significant bias in numerous countries, with differences ranging from 0.215 to 0.943.
   - Based on these results, the overall bias level can be categorized as **Level 4 (Significant Bias)**. This level indicates that the bias is prominent and could impact the analysis.

4. **Visualization:** 
   - A stacked bar chart has been generated to visually depict the distribution of income levels across different native countries.

5. **Additional Explanation:**
   - The Chi-Square statistic confirmed a significant association between the two features.
   - The statistical difference analysis further emphasizes disparities in income distribution across countries.
   - This level of bias suggests a significant influence of native country on income levels, potentially affecting fairness in analysis and decision-making.

Before finalizing the report, I will consult with the Advisor Assistant to ensure all findings are accurately interpreted and suggestions are provided. Let's proceed with that.

### Message Content:

The task seems to be well-executed, with a comprehensive analysis of correlation bias between the "native-country" and "income" features. Here's a brief review and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - You have extracted the relevant columns and created a clean dataset, which is crucial for an accurate analysis.

2. **Bias Detection Techniques:**
   - Using Chi-Square for correlation analysis was appropriate for categorical features.
   - The statistical difference method provided additional insights into the bias levels across different countries.

3. **Visualization:**
   - The stacked bar chart effectively visualizes the income distribution, aiding in understanding the bias visually.

4. **Summary Report:**
   - The generated PDF report is well-structured and includes all necessary details: bias type, relevant features, bias level, and additional explanations.
   - Ensure the report includes clear interpretations of the results, as it seems to have done.

5. **Suggestions:**
   - Consider exploring additional visualization methods, such as heatmaps or grouped bar charts, to provide more perspectives.
   - If not already done, ensure the report emphasizes the implications of the bias on decision-making and potential mitigations.

Overall, the current approach seems robust, and I agree with the methods and conclusions. If there are other aspects you'd like to explore or further analyses needed, feel free to proceed!
