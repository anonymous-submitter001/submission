### Message Content:

Great! You've asked if there is a link between where students live (urban or rural) and their final grades. This sounds like a correlation task between a categorical feature (location: urban or rural) and a numerical feature (final grades).

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Dataset Understanding and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset from the specified path: `source_files/Student Performance.csv`.
   - Identify the columns related to the students' location and their final grades.
   - Clean the data to ensure there are no missing or invalid values in these columns.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods**:
   - Since the task involves a correlation between a categorical and a numerical feature, we can use several methods to detect bias:
     - **Cohen's d**: This will help us determine the effect size of the location on the final grades.
     - **Standardized Difference**: This will provide another perspective on the bias by evaluating the difference between groups.
     - **Causal Effect**: Utilizing causal inference to estimate the causal impact of location on final grades.

3. **Visualization Approaches**:
   - Use box plots to visualize the distribution of final grades across different locations.
   - Use grouped bar charts to present the average final grades by location.

4. **Result Summarization**:
   - Summarize the bias type, relevant features, and bias level based on the results from each method.
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the findings and generate a bias detection report.

Now, I will reach out to Advisor Assistant for any additional suggestions or modifications to this plan.

### Message Content:

The dataset has been successfully loaded, and I've identified the following relevant columns for our analysis:

- **Location**: The `address` column, which indicates whether a student lives in an urban ('U') or rural ('R') area.
- **Final Grades**: The `G3` column, representing the students' final grades.

Now, let's proceed with our plan by preparing the dataset and selecting appropriate methods for bias detection and analysis.

### Preparation:
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure there are no missing values in the `address` and `G3` columns.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract the `address` and `G3` columns for focused analysis.

### Method Selection for Bias Detection:
1. **Cohen's d**: To measure the effect size of the location (urban vs. rural) on students' final grades.
2. **Standardized Difference**: To analyze the standardized difference in final grades between the urban and rural groups.
3. **Causal Effect using DoWhy Library**: To estimate the causal impact of living location on final grades.

Before executing the plan, let's consult with the Advisor Assistant to ensure we have selected the most appropriate methods and approach.

### Summary of Analysis

Based on the analysis conducted using the dataset, here are the detailed findings:

1. **Bias Type**: Correlation
2. **Relevant Features**: `address` (Location: Urban/Rural) and `G3` (Final Grades)
3. **Bias Level**:

   - **Cohen's d**:
     - **Effect Size**: 0.255
     - **Bias Level**: Level 2 (Minimal Bias)
     - **Explanation**: Cohen's d value of 0.255 indicates a small effect size, suggesting that the difference in final grades between urban and rural students is minimal. This value falls within the range of 0.25 to 0.5, categorized as Level 2 bias.

   - **Standardized Difference**:
     - **Value**: -0.301
     - **Bias Level**: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)
     - **Explanation**: The standardized difference of -0.301 indicates a moderate difference between the two groups, categorized as Level 3 bias. This suggests that the location may have a moderate impact on the final grades.

   - **Causal Effect**:
     - **Average Causal Effect (ACE)**: 1.163
     - **Bias Level**: Level 2 (Minimal Bias)
     - **Explanation**: The ACE value of 1.163 indicates a minimal causal impact of location on final grades, categorized as Level 2 bias. This suggests that the effect of location, while present, is not substantial.

4. **Overall Bias Level**: Taking into account the results from multiple methods, the overall bias level is summarized as **Level 2 (Minimal Bias)**.

5. **Additional Explanation**:
   - The analyses conducted using different methods indicate that there is a minimal to moderate bias in the correlation between where students live and their final grades. While there is some effect, it is not significant enough to deter the use of this dataset for further analysis.

In conclusion, based on my analysis, it appears that the feature `address` in this dataset shows a minimal bias in relation to the final grades `G3`. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics suggest only slight variations. For instance, Cohen's d returned a value of 0.255, the standardized difference measured -0.301, and the causal effect was calculated as 1.163. While the bias is minor, I believe the dataset is still suitable for use, with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.

Let's generate the detection report next. Before proceeding, I'll consult with Advisor Assistant to confirm that the analysis and conclusions are comprehensive and accurate.
