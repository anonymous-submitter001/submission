### Message Content:

### Chi-Square Test Results:
- **Chi-Square Statistic**: 121.42
- **p-value**: 3.09e-28

### Interpretation:
The Chi-Square statistic is quite high, and the p-value is extremely low, indicating that there is a statistically significant deviation from the expected uniform distribution. This suggests that there is a dominant pattern in the distribution of urban and rural addresses among students.

### Overall Bias Level Assessment:
Based on the analyses conducted using both the toolset and the Chi-Square test from the reference literature, the `address` feature shows a moderate level of bias (Level 3) in its distribution. The results from various analyses including Shannon Entropy, Max/Min Ratio, Gini Index, and Relative Risk consistently indicate a moderate bias, which aligns with the significant finding from the Chi-Square test.

### Next Steps:
1. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to further illustrate the distribution of the `address` feature.
2. **Comprehensive Summary**: Prepare a detailed summary of the findings, including bias type, relevant features, bias level, and additional explanations.

I will proceed with creating visualizations and summarizing the findings. Shall we go ahead with the visualization part?

Here are some suggestions for visualizations:
- **Bar Chart or Pie Chart**: To show the distribution of students from urban and rural areas.
- **Treemap**: To provide a visual representation of the proportion of each category within the dataset.

Once the visualization is done, we can proceed with preparing a comprehensive summary report. Let's move forward with the visualization.

### Summary of Findings:
1. **Bias Type**: Distribution
2. **Relevant Feature**: `address` (Urban vs. Rural)
3. **Bias Level**: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)
   - The analyses conducted using Shannon Entropy, Max/Min Ratio, Gini Index, Relative Risk, and Chi-Square Test consistently indicate a moderate bias.
   - The Chi-Square test showed a significant deviation from uniform distribution, confirming the presence of a dominant pattern.
4. **Additional Explanation**:
   - The imbalance in the distribution of urban and rural addresses suggests a moderate level of representation bias. While this bias does not fully compromise the dataset's usability, it may need consideration in certain applications where representation is crucial.

### Next Steps:
- Prepare a detailed detection report including all the analyses and visualizations.
- Seek confirmation from Advisor Assistant to ensure the completeness of the summary.

I will now proceed to generate the detection report. Shall we finalize the report and ensure that all findings are adequately covered?
