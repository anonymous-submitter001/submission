## Execution Steps
### Tool: `get_user_input_tool`
- **Input:** `{"input_text": "Please describe the bias detection task, e.g., 'Check if age and gender are correlated in dataset.csv', and provide the dataset to be used."}`
- **Log:** Thought: I need to ask the user to provide a clear detection task and the dataset to be used.
Action: get_user_input_tool
Action Input: {"input_text": "Please describe the bias detection task, e.g., 'Check if age and gender are correlated in dataset.csv', and provide the dataset to be used."}
- **Result:** `Could there be a link between where students live (urban or rural) and their final grades? The path to the dataset is source_files/Student Performance.csv. If a tool report error, skip it `

---

### Tool: `get_csv_features`
- **Input:** `{"csv_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv"}`
- **Log:** Thought: Now that I have the detection task and the dataset, I need to understand what features are available in the dataset.
Action: get_csv_features
Action Input: {"csv_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for get_csv_features: ['file_path']", 'tool_description': 'Read a CSV file and return all feature names (column names).\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to read. Example: "example_test_.csv"\n\nReturns:\n    str: A message indicating whether the CSV file was successfully read and listing all feature names,\n         or an error message if the file could not be read.'}`

---

### Tool: `load_csv_file`
- **Input:** `{"csv_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv"}`
- **Log:** Thought: It seems like the get_csv_features tool reported an error due to missing required parameters. However, I provided the csv_path in the action input. I will try again with a different approach to load the csv file and get its features.

Action: load_csv_file
Action Input: {"csv_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for load_csv_file: ['file_path']", 'tool_description': 'Load a CSV file and return it as a Pandas DataFrame.\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to load.\n\nReturns:\n    pd.DataFrame: The loaded data as a Pandas DataFrame, or an error message if the process failed.'}`

---

### Tool: `get_csv_features`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv"}`
- **Log:** Thought: It seems like the load_csv_file tool also reported an error due to missing required parameters, despite providing the csv_path in the action input. I will try again with a different approach to get the features of the csv file.

Action: get_csv_features
Action Input: {"file_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv"}
- **Result:** `Successfully read the CSV file. The features are:
['school', 'sex', 'age', 'address', 'famsize', 'Pstatus', 'Medu', 'Fedu', 'Mjob', 'Fjob', 'reason', 'guardian', 'traveltime', 'studytime', 'failures', 'schoolsup', 'famsup', 'paid', 'activities', 'nursery', 'higher', 'internet', 'romantic', 'famrel', 'freetime', 'goout', 'Dalc', 'Walc', 'health', 'absences', 'G1', 'G2', 'G3']

### Tool: `extract_two_columns`
- **Input:** `{"csv_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv", "column1": "address", "column2": "G3"}`
- **Log:** Thought: Now that I have the features of the dataset, I can proceed with the bias detection task. The user wants to know if there is a link between where students live (urban or rural) and their final grades. This means I need to analyze the correlation between the 'address' feature and the 'G3' feature.

Action: extract_two_columns
Action Input: {"csv_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv", "column1": "address", "column2": "G3"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for extract_two_columns: ['file_path', 'new_dataset_name']", 'tool_description': 'Extract two columns from a CSV file and save them as a new dataset.\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to read (e.g., "path/to/data.csv").\n    column1 (str): The name of the first column to extract (e.g., "Age").\n    column2 (str): The name of the second column to extract (e.g., "Occupation").\n    new_dataset_name (str): The name of the new dataset file to save (without file extension) (e.g., "age_occupation_dataset").\n\nReturns:\n    str: A message indicating whether the columns were successfully extracted and saved as a new dataset in the \n         "generated_files" directory, or an error message if the process failed. The new dataset file will be saved \n         as "generated_files/{new_dataset_name}.csv".'}`

### Tool: `extract_two_columns`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv", "column1": "address", "column2": "G3", "new_dataset_name": "address_G3_dataset"}`
- **Log:** Thought: It seems like the extract_two_columns tool reported an error due to missing required parameters. However, I provided the csv_path, column1, and column2 in the action input. I will try again with a different approach to extract the two columns.

Action: extract_two_columns
Action Input: {"file_path": "source_files/Student Performance.csv", "column1": "address", "column2": "G3", "new_dataset_name": "address_G3_dataset"}
- **Result:** `Successfully created new dataset: generated_files\address_G3_dataset.csv `

### Tool: `categorical_numerical_correlation_max_abs_mean`
- **Input:** `{"csv_path": "generated_files/address_G3_dataset.csv", "categorical_column": "address", "numerical_column": "G3"}`
- **Log:** Thought: Now that I have extracted the two columns, I can proceed with the bias detection task. The user wants to know if there is a link between where students live (urban or rural) and their final grades. This means I need to analyze the correlation between the 'address' feature and the 'G3' feature.

Action: categorical_numerical_correlation_max_abs_mean
Action Input: {"csv_path": "generated_files/address_G3_dataset.csv", "categorical_column": "address", "numerical_column": "G3"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_numerical_correlation_max_abs_mean: ['file_path', 'column_cat', 'column_num']", 'tool_description': 'Perform correlation bias analysis between a categorical and a numerical feature.\n\nThis method calculates the correlation between one categorical feature and one numerical feature by \nstandardizing the numerical feature and computing the mean for each category. The bias is then determined\nby analyzing the maximum absolute mean (N value) for each category after standardization.\n\nBased on the maximum absolute N value, the bias is categorized into different levels:\n    - Max |N| < 0.1: Level 1\n    - 0.1 <= Max |N| < 0.2: Level 2\n    - 0.2 <= Max |N| < 0.3: Level 3\n    - 0.3 <= Max |N| < 0.4: Level 4\n    - Max |N| >= 0.4: Level 5\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to read.\n    column_cat (str): The name of the categorical column.\n    column_num (str): The name of the numerical column.\n\nReturns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the maximum absolute N value,\n          or an error message if the process failed.'}`
