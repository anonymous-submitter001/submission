## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The distribution of family relationships is moderately skewed and slightly platykurtic, indicating a moderate level of bias, which is categorized as Level 3. The relevant feature is "famrel". The bias report PDF has been successfully generated and saved at "generated_files/bias_report.pdf", providing a detailed explanation of the bias extent and related findings. The overall bias level is Level 3.

## Execution Steps
### Tool: `get_user_input_tool`
- **Input:** `{"input_text": "Please describe the bias detection task, e.g., 'Check if age and gender are correlated in dataset.csv', and provide the dataset to be used."}`
- **Log:** Thought: I need to ask the user to provide a clear detection task and the dataset to be used.
Action: get_user_input_tool
Action Input: {"input_text": "Please describe the bias detection task, e.g., 'Check if age and gender are correlated in dataset.csv', and provide the dataset to be used."}
- **Result:** `Iâ€™m curious whether students report similar levels of family relationship quality. Can you check if there are significant differences in how they perceive their family relationships? The path to the dataset is source_files/Student Performance.csv. If a tool report error, skip it `

- **Input:** `{"data": "generated_files/family_relationships.csv"}`
- **Log:** Thought: Now that I have extracted the relevant feature, which is the family relationships, I need to check for significant differences in how students perceive their family relationships. To do this, I can use a statistical method to analyze the distribution of the family relationships. 

Action: categorical_distribution_shannon_balance
Action Input: {"data": "generated_files/family_relationships.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_distribution_shannon_balance: ['file_path', 'column_name']", 'tool_description': 'Perform distribution bias analysis on a categorical column using Shannon entropy and Balance metric.\n\nThis method calculates Shannon entropy to measure the uncertainty (or information content) \nof the categorical distribution, and the Balance metric to evaluate how evenly the categories \nare distributed in the dataset.\n\nThe bias is evaluated according to the Balance metric with the following thresholds:\n    - Balance >= 0.95: Level 1\n    - 0.80 <= Balance < 0.95: Level 2\n    - 0.65 <= Balance < 0.80: Level 3\n    - 0.50 <= Balance < 0.65: Level 4\n    - Balance < 0.50: Level 5\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to read.\n    column_name (str): The name of the categorical column to analyze.\n\nReturns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the balance metric and Shannon entropy of the column,\n          or an error message if the process failed.'}`

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_skewness`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/family_relationships.csv", "column_name": "famrel"}`
- **Log:** Thought: It seems like the categorical_distribution_shannon_balance tool is not suitable for this task because the family relationships feature is not categorical. I need to use a different tool to analyze the distribution of the family relationships. 

Action: numerical_distribution_skewness
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/family_relationships.csv", "column_name": "famrel"}
- **Result:** `{'Skewness': -0.951881690060932}`

- **Log:** Thought: Now that I have analyzed the distribution of the family relationships using the numerical_distribution_skewness tool, I can see that the skewness is -0.951881690060932, which indicates a moderate level of skewness. This suggests that the distribution of family relationships is not perfectly symmetrical.

Action: numerical_distribution_kurtosis

- **Log:** Thought: Now that I have analyzed the distribution of the family relationships using the numerical_distribution_skewness and numerical_distribution_kurtosis tools, I can see that the skewness is -0.951881690060932 and the kurtosis is 1.1397722938283108. These values indicate a moderate level of skewness and a slightly platykurtic distribution, which suggests that the distribution of family relationships is not perfectly symmetrical and has a slightly lighter tail than a normal distribution.
