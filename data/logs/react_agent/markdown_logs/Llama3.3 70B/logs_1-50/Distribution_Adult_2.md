## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The final answer is a bias report that includes the following information: 
Bias Type: Distribution
Relevant Feature(s): workclass
Bias Level: 3
Additional Explanation: The distribution of the 'workclass' column shows a moderate bias, with the 'Private' category having the highest count. The bias level is 3, indicating that the distribution is somewhat uneven.

## Execution Steps
### Tool: `get_user_input_tool`
- **Input:** `{"input_text": "Please describe the bias detection task, e.g., 'Check if age and gender are correlated in dataset.csv', and provide the dataset to be used."}`
- **Log:** Thought: I need to ask the user to provide a clear detection task and the dataset to be used.
Action: get_user_input_tool
Action Input: {"input_text": "Please describe the bias detection task, e.g., 'Check if age and gender are correlated in dataset.csv', and provide the dataset to be used."}
- **Result:** `How does the distribution of work class look to you? Are there any work classes that appear to be overrepresented? The path to the dataset is source_files/Adult.csv. `

---

### Tool: `load_csv_file`
- **Input:** `{"csv_path": "source_files/Adult.csv"}`
- **Log:** Thought: The user has provided a clear detection task, which is to analyze the distribution of work class in the Adult.csv dataset and identify if there are any work classes that appear to be overrepresented. The task involves understanding the distribution of a categorical feature, which can be achieved by using tools such as categorical_distribution_shannon_balance, categorical_distribution_max_min_ratio, categorical_distribution_entropy, categorical_distribution_gini, and categorical_distribution_relative_risk.

Action: load_csv_file
Action Input: {"csv_path": "source_files/Adult.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for load_csv_file: ['file_path']", 'tool_description': 'Load a CSV file and return it as a Pandas DataFrame.\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to load.\n\nReturns:\n    pd.DataFrame: The loaded data as a Pandas DataFrame, or an error message if the process failed.'}`

---

### Tool: `load_csv_file`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "source_files/Adult.csv"}`
- **Log:** Thought: It seems like the load_csv_file tool requires a 'file_path' parameter instead of 'csv_path'. I should correct this and try again.

- **Log:** Thought: It seems like the previous tools and approaches were unable to analyze the distribution of the 'workclass' column. I will try a different approach using the execute_python_code tool to write a custom Python code to analyze the distribution of the 'workclass' column.
