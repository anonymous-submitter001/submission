## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The bias detection analysis for the dataset "source_files/Adult.csv" focused on the correlation between "native-country" and "income". Here's a detailed summary of the findings:

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** "native-country" and "income"
3. **Bias Level:**
   - **Cramér's V Analysis:** The Cramér's V value of 0.0987 indicates a very weak association between "native-country" and "income", corresponding to Level 1 bias (No Bias). This suggests no significant correlation between these two features.
   - **Statistical Parity Analysis:** The maximum Z-value of 0.5632 indicates a moderate level of bias in the distribution of income across different native countries, corresponding to Level 3 bias (Moderate Bias).

**Feedback to the User:**
- **Level 1 (No Bias):** Based on the Cramér's V analysis, the correlation between "native-country" and "income" shows no significant bias. The Cramér's V value of 0.0987 is very close to the ideal state, indicating a very weak association. You can confidently proceed with using this dataset for correlation analysis.
- **Level 3 (Moderate Bias):** However, the Statistical Parity analysis suggests a moderate level of bias in the distribution of income across different native countries. The maximum Z-value of 0.5632 indicates some bias present. While these results do not fully compromise the dataset’s usability, you may need to consider this bias in certain applications. I recommend giving these results additional thought before proceeding.

**Additional Explanation:** The analysis reveals a discrepancy between the correlation and distribution assessments. While the correlation between "native-country" and "income" is weak, the income distribution across different native countries shows moderate bias. This suggests that while the native country may not strongly influence income, there are variations in income distribution that should be considered in specific contexts.

The overall bias level is summarized as moderate, considering both analyses. However, this overall bias level is not included in the generated detection report.

### Tool: `extract_two_columns`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "source_files/Adult.csv, native-country, income"}`
- **Log:** The dataset has been successfully loaded. It contains 32,561 rows and 15 columns. The relevant features for the user's task are "native-country" (categorical) and "income" (categorical, as it is represented by two categories: <=50K and >50K).

Now, I will formulate an overall plan for executing the task:

1. **Understanding and Preprocessing the Dataset:**
   - Extract the relevant columns: "native-country" and "income".
   - Clean any missing values in these columns to ensure accurate analysis.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Since both "native-country" and "income" are categorical variables, I will use methods suitable for categorical-categorical correlation analysis.
   - From the available toolset, I will use the following methods:
     - **Cramér's V**: To measure the strength of association between two categorical variables.
     - **Statistical Parity**: To assess if there is a significant difference in income distribution across different native countries.
   - Additionally, I will explore reference literature to find any other relevant methods with an ending digit greater than 5.

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use a heatmap to visualize the correlation between "native-country" and "income".
   - Use a bar chart to display the distribution of income across different native countries.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings, specifying the type of bias, relevant features, and bias level.
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the results and their implications.

Next, I will extract the relevant columns and clean any missing values.
