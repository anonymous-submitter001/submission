- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_hours_per_week_dataset.csv"}`
- **Log:** The "hours-per-week" column has been successfully cleaned, and the cleaned dataset is saved. Now, I will proceed with the distribution analysis using skewness, kurtosis, and outlier detection to understand the concentration of values in this column.

**Plan for Execution:**

1. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Calculate skewness to understand the asymmetry of the distribution.
   - Calculate kurtosis to understand the peakedness of the distribution.
   - Identify outliers to detect any concentration in certain ranges.

2. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Plot a histogram to visually assess the distribution of "hours-per-week."
   - Use a box plot to identify outliers and visualize the spread of the data.

Let's start by calculating the skewness of the "hours-per-week" column.

Action: numerical_distribution_skewness
Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_hours_per_week_dataset.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for numerical_distribution_skewness: ['file_path', 'column_name']", 'tool_description': 'Perform distribution bias analysis on a specified numerical column using skewness.\n\nThis method calculates the skewness of the numerical column to assess the distribution bias. \nBased on the skewness value, the bias is categorized into different levels:\n    - Absolute Skewness < 0.5: Level 1\n    - 0.5 <= Absolute Skewness < 0.8: Level 2\n    - 0.8 <= Absolute Skewness < 0.9: Level 3\n    - 0.9 <= Absolute Skewness < 1: Level 4\n    - Absolute Skewness >= 1: Level 5\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to read.\n    column_name (str): The name of the numerical column to analyze.\n\nReturns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the skewness value of the column,\n          or an error message if the process failed.'}`

---

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_skewness`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_hours_per_week_dataset.csv", "column_name": " hours-per-week"}`
- **Log:** To calculate the skewness, I need to provide the file path and the column name. Let's proceed with this information.

Action: numerical_distribution_skewness
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_hours_per_week_dataset.csv", "column_name": " hours-per-week"}
- **Result:** `{'Skewness': 0.22764253680450092}`

---

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_kurtosis`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_hours_per_week_dataset.csv", "column_name": " hours-per-week"}`
- **Log:** The skewness of the "hours-per-week" column is approximately 0.23, which indicates a slight positive skew. This suggests that the distribution of weekly work hours is slightly skewed to the right, but the skewness is not significant.

Next, I will calculate the kurtosis to understand the peakedness of the distribution.

Action: numerical_distribution_kurtosis
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_hours_per_week_dataset.csv", "column_name": " hours-per-week"}
- **Result:** `{'Kurtosis': 2.916686796002066}`

---

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_outlier`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_hours_per_week_dataset.csv", "column_name": " hours-per-week"}`
- **Log:** The kurtosis of the "hours-per-week" column is approximately 2.92, which is close to the normal distribution kurtosis value of 3. This indicates that the distribution has a shape similar to a normal distribution, with no significant peaks or flatness.

Now, I will identify any outliers in the "hours-per-week" column to detect any concentration in certain ranges.

Action: numerical_distribution_outlier
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_hours_per_week_dataset.csv", "column_name": " hours-per-week"}
- **Result:** `{'Outlier_Percentage': 1.3513098492061055}`

---

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "The analysis of the 'hours-per-week' feature in the dataset indicates a balanced distribution with no significant bias. The skewness is 0.23, kurtosis is 2.92, and outliers account for 1.35% of the data. The distribution is similar to a normal distribution, suggesting minimal concentration in specific ranges."}`
- **Log:** The outlier analysis indicates that approximately 1.35% of the data points in the "hours-per-week" column are considered outliers. This suggests that there is a small concentration of values that deviate significantly from the rest of the data.

**Summary of Findings:**

1. **Bias Type:** Distribution
2. **Relevant Feature(s):** hours-per-week
3. **Bias Level:** Based on the analysis, the bias level can be categorized as Level 1 (No Bias) due to the following observations:
   - **Skewness:** The skewness value of 0.23 indicates a slight positive skew, suggesting a minor asymmetry in the distribution.
   - **Kurtosis:** The kurtosis value of 2.92 is close to the normal distribution value, indicating no significant peaks or flatness.
   - **Outliers:** Only 1.35% of the data points are outliers, suggesting minimal concentration in certain ranges.

**Feedback to User:**

Based on my analysis, it appears that the "hours-per-week" feature in this dataset shows no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the skewness value is 0.23, the kurtosis is 2.92, and the outlier percentage is 1.35%. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.

**Additional Explanation:**

The distribution of weekly work hours is slightly skewed to the right, but this skewness is not significant enough to indicate bias. The kurtosis value suggests that the distribution is similar to a normal distribution, and the low percentage of outliers indicates minimal concentration in specific ranges. Overall, the dataset's distribution of weekly work hours is balanced and suitable for analysis.

**Next Steps:**

I will generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.
