## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the dataset "Adult.csv" focused on detecting correlation bias between the features "education" and "race". The methods used were Cramér's V and Statistical Parity. The results indicate a Level 1 bias according to Cramér's V, suggesting no significant correlation, and a Level 2 bias according to Statistical Parity, indicating a low level of correlation. Overall, the bias level is categorized as Level 2, meaning there is a low level of correlation between education and race in the dataset. A detailed detection report has been generated and saved as a PDF, which you can find at: generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf.

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/education_race_dataset.csv"}`
- **Log:** The columns "education" and "race" have been successfully extracted into a new dataset named "education_race_dataset.csv". Now, I will proceed with the correlation analysis between these two categorical features.

To detect the correlation between two categorical variables, I will use methods such as Cramér's V and Statistical Parity. These methods will help in understanding the strength and nature of the relationship between education and race.

I will start by applying Cramér's V to measure the association between these two categorical variables.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/education_race_dataset.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v: ['file_path', 'column_a', 'column_b']", 'tool_description': "Perform correlation bias analysis on two specified categorical columns using Cramér's V.\n\nThis method calculates Cramér's V to measure the association between two categorical variables\nbased on the chi-square statistic. The bias is evaluated based on the Cramér's V value:\n    - Cramér's V < 0.1: Level 1\n    - 0.1 <= Cramér's V < 0.3: Level 2\n    - 0.3 <= Cramér's V < 0.5: Level 3\n    - 0.5 <= Cramér's V < 0.7: Level 4\n    - Cramér's V >= 0.7: Level 5\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to read.\n    column_a (str): The name of the first categorical column.\n    column_b (str): The name of the second categorical column.\n\nReturns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the Cramér's V value,\n          or an error message if the process failed."}`

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/education_race_dataset.csv", "column_a": " education", "column_b": " race"}`
- **Log:** I need to provide the correct parameters for the Cramér's V method, including the file path and the names of the columns to analyze. I will specify these parameters correctly.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/education_race_dataset.csv", "column_a": " education", "column_b": " race"}
- **Result:** `{'Cramers_V': 0.0749000591364637}`

---

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/education_race_dataset.csv", "column_a": " education", "column_b": " race"}`
- **Log:** The Cramér's V value for the correlation between "education" and "race" is approximately 0.0749. According to the bias evaluation criteria for Cramér's V:

- Cramér's V < 0.1: Level 1 (No significant bias)
- 0.1 <= Cramér's V < 0.3: Level 2
- 0.3 <= Cramér's V < 0.5: Level 3
- 0.5 <= Cramér's V < 0.7: Level 4
- Cramér's V >= 0.7: Level 5

The Cramér's V value of 0.0749 indicates a Level 1 bias, which means there is no significant correlation between "education" and "race" in the dataset.

Next, I will apply the Statistical Parity method to further analyze the correlation between these two categorical features.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/education_race_dataset.csv", "column_a": " education", "column_b": " race"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity: ['column_x', 'column_y']", 'tool_description': 'Perform correlation bias analysis on two specified categorical columns using statistical parity and Z-scores.\n\nThis method calculates the Z-scores for differences in proportions between groups defined by \nfeature X on feature Y, based on statistical parity.

---

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/education_race_dataset.csv", "column_x": " education", "column_y": " race"}`
- **Log:** I need to provide the correct parameters for the Statistical Parity method, including the file path and the names of the columns to analyze. I will specify these parameters correctly.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/education_race_dataset.csv", "column_x": " education", "column_y": " race"}
- **Result:** `{'Max_Z_value': 0.4980326250197531}`

---

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "The analysis of the dataset 'Adult.csv' focused on detecting correlation bias between the features 'education' and 'race'. The methods used were Cramér's V and Statistical Parity. The results indicate a Level 1 bias according to Cramér's V, suggesting no significant correlation, and a Level 2 bias according to Statistical Parity, indicating a low level of correlation. Overall, the bias level is categorized as Level 2, meaning there is a low level of correlation between education and race in the dataset."}`
- **Log:** The Statistical Parity method returned a maximum Z-value of approximately 0.498. According to the bias evaluation criteria for Statistical Parity:

- Max Z-value <= 0.25: Level 1 (No significant bias)
- 0.25 < Max Z-value <= 0.50: Level 2
- 0.50 < Max Z-value <= 0.75: Level 3
- 0.75 < Max Z-value <= 1.00: Level 4
- Max Z-value > 1.00: Level 5

The maximum Z-value of 0.498 indicates a Level 2 bias, which suggests a low level of correlation between "education" and "race" in the dataset.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Bias Type**: Correlation
2. **Relevant Features**: Education, Race
3. **Bias Levels**:
   - **Cramér's V**: Level 1 (No significant bias)
   - **Statistical Parity**: Level 2 (Low level of correlation)
4. **Overall Bias Level**: Level 2 (Low level of correlation)

### Explanation:

- **Cramér's V Analysis**: The Cramér's V value of 0.0749 indicates that there is no significant correlation between the "education" and "race" features. This suggests that the distribution of education levels is relatively independent of race categories in the dataset.

- **Statistical Parity Analysis**: The maximum Z-value of 0.498 suggests a low level of correlation between "education" and "race". This indicates that while there might be some differences in the distribution of education levels across different races, these differences are not substantial.

Overall, the analysis shows a low level of correlation between education and race, indicating that these features do not significantly influence each other in the dataset.

I will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.
