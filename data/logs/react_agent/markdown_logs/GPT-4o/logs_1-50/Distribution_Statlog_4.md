## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the "Duration in month" feature in your dataset indicates a very severe bias due to its high skewness value of 1.094, suggesting that certain durations are over-represented. The kurtosis value of 0.92 indicates moderate tailedness, and the outlier percentage is 1.4%, showing a relatively low presence of extreme values. This level of bias may significantly affect the dataset's reliability, and I recommend considering adjustments to mitigate these effects. A detailed PDF report has been generated and saved at "generated_files/duration_in_month_bias_report.pdf". If you have any additional needs or tasks, please let me know.

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_skewness`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv"}`
- **Log:** The "Duration in month" column has been successfully cleaned and saved as a new dataset. Now, I will proceed with the detection and analysis of the distribution using the selected numerical distribution analysis methods.

1. **Numerical Distribution Skewness**: This will help measure the asymmetry of the distribution.
2. **Numerical Distribution Kurtosis**: This will assess the tailedness of the distribution.
3. **Numerical Distribution Outlier**: This will identify any outliers that may indicate over-representation of certain durations.

Let's start with calculating the skewness of the distribution.

Action: numerical_distribution_skewness
Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for numerical_distribution_skewness: ['file_path', 'column_name']", 'tool_description': 'Perform distribution bias analysis on a specified numerical column using skewness.\n\nThis method calculates the skewness of the numerical column to assess the distribution bias. \nBased on the skewness value, the bias is categorized into different levels:\n    - Absolute Skewness < 0.5: Level 1\n    - 0.5 <= Absolute Skewness < 0.8: Level 2\n    - 0.8 <= Absolute Skewness < 0.9: Level 3\n    - 0.9 <= Absolute Skewness < 1: Level 4\n    - Absolute Skewness >= 1: Level 5\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to read.\n    column_name (str): The name of the numerical column to analyze.\n\nReturns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the skewness value of the column,\n          or an error message if the process failed.'}`

---

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_skewness`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv", "column_name": "Duration in month"}`
- **Log:** I need to provide the correct parameters for calculating the skewness of the "Duration in month" column.

Action: numerical_distribution_skewness
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv", "column_name": "Duration in month"}
- **Result:** `{'Skewness': 1.0941841715555418}`

---

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_kurtosis`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv", "column_name": "Duration in month"}`
- **Log:** The skewness of the "Duration in month" column is 1.094, which indicates a high level of asymmetry in the distribution. According to the skewness bias levels, this falls into Level 5, suggesting extreme bias. Next, I will calculate the kurtosis to further understand the distribution's tailedness.

Action: numerical_distribution_kurtosis
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv", "column_name": "Duration in month"}
- **Result:** `{'Kurtosis': 0.9197813600546372}`

---

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_outlier`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv", "column_name": "Duration in month"}`
- **Log:** The kurtosis of the "Duration in month" column is 0.92, which suggests a distribution with tails that are not significantly heavier or lighter than a normal distribution. This indicates a moderate level of tailedness. Now, I will identify any outliers in the distribution to check for over-representation of certain durations.

Action: numerical_distribution_outlier
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv", "column_name": "Duration in month"}
- **Result:** `{'Outlier_Percentage': 1.4000000000000001}`

---

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv"}`
- **Log:** The outlier analysis shows that 1.4% of the data points in the "Duration in month" column are considered outliers. This percentage indicates a relatively low presence of outliers, suggesting that while there are some extreme values, they do not dominate the dataset.

**Overall Workflow and Summary:**

1. **Bias Type**: Distribution
2. **Relevant Feature**: Duration in month
3. **Bias Level**: 
   - **Skewness**: The skewness value of 1.094 indicates a high level of asymmetry, placing it in Level 5 (Extreme Bias). This suggests that the distribution is heavily skewed, with certain durations being over-represented.
   - **Kurtosis**: The kurtosis value of 0.92 suggests moderate tailedness, indicating that the distribution's tails are not significantly different from a normal distribution.
   - **Outliers**: With 1.4% of the data points being outliers, the presence of extreme values is relatively low, suggesting that while there are some over-represented durations, they do not overwhelmingly affect the dataset.

**Feedback to User**:
Based on my analysis, the "Duration in month" feature in this dataset shows a very severe bias due to its high skewness. The results from the tools I used indicate that the distribution is heavily skewed, with a skewness value of 1.094. The kurtosis value of 0.92 suggests moderate tailedness, and the outlier percentage is 1.4%, indicating a relatively low presence of extreme values. This level of bias may significantly affect the dataset's reliability, and I strongly recommend thoroughly considering the implications of this bias. You may need to adjust the dataset to mitigate these effects.

**Additional Explanation**:
The high skewness indicates that the distribution of employment duration is not balanced, with certain durations being over-represented. This could lead to biased insights if not addressed. The moderate kurtosis suggests that the distribution's tails are not extreme, but the presence of outliers, although low, should be considered in the analysis.

I will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.
