## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the dataset "Adult.csv" revealed significant biases associated with occupation. The distribution of occupations shows a moderate level of bias (Level 2), while the correlation between occupation and workclass indicates an extreme level of bias (Level 5). The findings suggest that certain occupations may be unfairly favored or associated with specific work classes, leading to potential biases in the dataset. The overall bias level is categorized as Level 5, indicating extreme bias. A detailed report has been generated and saved as "generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf".

- **Log:** I need to correct the action input to include the correct parameters for performing the Shannon Balance analysis on the "occupation" column.

Action: categorical_distribution_shannon_balance
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_occupation_dataset.csv", "column_name": " occupation"}
- **Result:** `{'Balance': 0.9001795617968483, 'Shannon_Entropy': 3.5169030643431043}`

---

### Tool: `categorical_distribution_max_min_ratio`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_occupation_dataset.csv", "column_name": " occupation"}`
- **Log:** The Shannon Balance analysis on the "occupation" column has been completed. The results are as follows:

- **Balance Metric**: 0.9002
- **Shannon Entropy**: 3.5169

Based on the Balance metric, the bias level is categorized as Level 2, indicating a moderate level of bias in the distribution of occupations. This suggests that the distribution of occupations is not perfectly even, but it is not extremely biased either.

Next, I will proceed with the Max-Min Ratio analysis to further understand the distribution of occupations.

Action: categorical_distribution_max_min_ratio
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_occupation_dataset.csv", "column_name": " occupation"}
- **Result:** `{' occupation': 460.0}`

---

### Tool: `categorical_distribution_entropy`

Next, I will proceed with the Gini analysis to further understand the distribution of occupations.

Action: categorical_distribution_gini
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_occupation_dataset.csv", "column_name": " occupation"}
- **Result:** `{'Corrected_Gini_Index': 0.9028591968368023, 'Adjusted_Gini_Index': 0.9673491394680024}`

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_total_variation`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "source_files/Adult.csv", "column_a": " occupation", "column_b": " workclass"}`
- **Log:** The Statistical Parity analysis on the "occupation" and "workclass" columns has been completed. The result is as follows:

- **Max Z-value**: 5.7373

This high Z-value indicates a significant difference in proportions between groups defined by "occupation" on "workclass". According to the bias evaluation based on the Z-score, this corresponds to a Level 5 bias, suggesting a strong association and potential bias between these two features.

Now, I will proceed with the Total Variation analysis to further understand the correlation between occupation and workclass.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_total_variation
Action Input: {"file_path": "source_files/Adult.csv", "column_a": " occupation", "column_b": " workclass"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_categorical_correlation_total_variation: ['column_x', 'column_y']", 'tool_description': 'Perform correlation bias analysis on two specified categorical columns using Total Variation Distance.\n\nThis method calculates the Total Variation Distance (TVD) between the overall distribution of feature Y \nand the group-specific distributions of feature Y, given feature X. It measures how different the \ngroup distributions are from the overall distribution.\n\nBased on the maximum TVD, the bias is categorized into different levels:\n    - Max TVD <= 0.1: Level 1\n    - 0.1 < Max TVD <= 0.2: Level 2\n    - 0.2 < Max TVD <= 0.3: Level 3\n    - 0.3 < Max TVD <= 0.4: Level 4\n    - Max TVD > 0.4: Level 5\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to read.\n    column_x (str): The name of the first categorical column.\n    column_y (str): The name of the second categorical column.\n\nReturns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the maximum Total Variation Distance,\n          or an error message if the process failed.'}`

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_total_variation`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "source_files/Adult.csv", "column_x": " occupation", "column_y": " workclass"}`
- **Log:** I need to correct the action input to include the correct parameter names for performing Total Variation analysis on the "occupation" and "workclass" columns.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_total_variation
Action Input: {"file_path": "source_files/Adult.csv", "column_x": " occupation", "column_y": " workclass"}
- **Result:** `{'Max_Total_Variation_Distance': 0.9705168760173213}`

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "The analysis of the dataset 'Adult.csv' revealed significant biases associated with occupation. The distribution of occupations shows a moderate level of bias, while the correlation between occupation and workclass indicates an extreme level of bias. The findings suggest that certain occupations may be unfairly favored or associated with specific work classes, leading to potential biases in the dataset. The overall bias level is categorized as Level 5, indicating extreme bias. Detailed analysis results are provided in the report."}`
- **Log:** The Total Variation analysis on the "occupation" and "workclass" columns has been completed. The result is as follows:

- **Max Total Variation Distance**: 0.9705

This high Total Variation Distance indicates a significant difference between the overall distribution of "workclass" and the group-specific distributions given "occupation". According to the bias evaluation based on the Total Variation Distance, this corresponds to a Level 5 bias, suggesting a strong association and potential bias between these two features.

Now, I will summarize the findings and generate a detailed report.

1. **Bias Type**: Both "Correlation" and "Distribution" biases were detected.
2. **Relevant Features**: "occupation" and "workclass".
3. **Bias Level**: 
   - **Distribution Bias**: Level 2 (Moderate bias) based on Shannon Balance and Entropy.
   - **Correlation Bias**: Level 5 (Extreme bias) based on Statistical Parity and Total Variation.
4. **Overall Bias Level**: Level 5 (Extreme bias) due to the strong correlation bias detected.

**Additional Explanation**: 
- The distribution analysis revealed a moderate level of bias in the distribution of occupations, indicating that some occupations are more prevalent than others.
- The correlation analysis showed a strong association between "occupation" and "workclass", with significant differences in proportions and distributions, indicating potential bias in how occupations are associated with work classes.

I will now generate the detection report.
