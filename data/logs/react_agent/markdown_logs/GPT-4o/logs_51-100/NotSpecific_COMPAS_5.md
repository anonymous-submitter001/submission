## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the COMPAS dataset focused on detecting any hidden influence of marital status on assessment outcomes. The relevant features analyzed were "MaritalStatus," "ScoreText," and "DecileScore." The correlation analysis revealed a low bias (Level 2) between "MaritalStatus" and "ScoreText," and a moderate bias (Level 3) between "MaritalStatus" and "DecileScore." Overall, the influence of marital status on the dataset is categorized as a moderate bias (Level 3). This suggests that while marital status has a minor impact on score text, it has a more significant effect on decile scores, which could influence assessment decisions. The findings highlight the importance of considering demographic factors like marital status in the assessment process to ensure fairness and accuracy. A detailed report has been generated and saved as "generated_files/COMPAS_Bias_Report.pdf".

### Tool: `clean_missing_values`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "source_files/COMPAS.csv"}`
- **Log:** The dataset contains a feature named "MaritalStatus," which is directly related to the user's inquiry about the influence of marital status. To investigate any hidden influence, I need to identify other features that might be affected by marital status. Commonly, features like "RecSupervisionLevel," "ScoreText," or "DecileScore" could be influenced by demographic factors such as marital status. I will proceed by formulating a plan to analyze the correlation between "MaritalStatus" and these potentially influenced features.

### Plan for Executing the Task:

1. **Understanding and Preprocessing the Dataset:**
   - Load the dataset and identify relevant features: "MaritalStatus" and other potentially influenced features like "RecSupervisionLevel," "ScoreText," and "DecileScore."
   - Clean the dataset by handling any missing values.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Use correlation analysis to detect any significant relationships between "MaritalStatus" and the selected features.
   - For categorical-categorical correlation, use methods like Cramér's V or Statistical Parity.
   - For categorical-numerical correlation, use methods like Cohen's D or Standardized Difference.

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use bar charts or heatmaps to visualize the distribution and correlation of "MaritalStatus" with other features.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings, specifying the type of bias, relevant features, and bias level.
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the bias extent and related findings.

I will start by cleaning the dataset to handle any missing values.

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/COMPAS_cleaned.csv", "column1": "MaritalStatus", "column2": "ScoreText"}`
- **Log:** The dataset has been successfully cleaned, and a new dataset named "COMPAS_cleaned.csv" has been created. Now, I will proceed with the correlation analysis to detect any significant relationships between "MaritalStatus" and the selected features: "RecSupervisionLevel," "ScoreText," and "DecileScore."

### Detection and Analysis Methods:

1. **Categorical-Categorical Correlation:**
   - Use Cramér's V to analyze the correlation between "MaritalStatus" and "ScoreText."

2. **Categorical-Numerical Correlation:**
   - Use Cohen's D to analyze the correlation between "MaritalStatus" and "DecileScore."

I will start by analyzing the categorical-categorical correlation using Cramér's V.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/COMPAS_cleaned.csv", "column1": "MaritalStatus", "column2": "ScoreText"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v: ['file_path', 'column_a', 'column_b']", 'tool_description': "Perform correlation bias analysis on two specified categorical columns using Cramér's V.\n\nThis method calculates Cramér's V to measure the association between two categorical variables\nbased on the chi-square statistic.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/COMPAS_cleaned.csv", "column_a": "MaritalStatus", "column_b": "ScoreText"}
- **Result:** `{'Cramers_V': 0.14269572844691367}`

---

### Tool: `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/COMPAS_cleaned.csv", "categorical_column": "MaritalStatus", "numerical_column": "DecileScore"}`
- **Log:** The Cramér's V value for the correlation between "MaritalStatus" and "ScoreText" is approximately 0.143. According to the bias evaluation criteria for Cramér's V:
- Cramér's V < 0.1: Level 1 (No bias)
- 0.1 <= Cramér's V < 0.3: Level 2 (Low bias)
- 0.3 <= Cramér's V < 0.5: Level 3 (Moderate bias)
- 0.5 <= Cramér's V < 0.7: Level 4 (High bias)
- Cramér's V >= 0.7: Level 5 (Extreme bias)

A Cramér's V value of 0.143 indicates a Level 2 bias, which suggests a low correlation between "MaritalStatus" and "ScoreText."

Next, I will analyze the categorical-numerical correlation using Cohen's D to assess the relationship between "MaritalStatus" and "DecileScore."

Action: categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d
Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/COMPAS_cleaned.csv", "categorical_column": "MaritalStatus", "numerical_column": "DecileScore"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d: ['file_path', 'column_cat', 'column_num']", 'tool_description': "Perform correlation bias analysis between a categorical and a numerical feature using Cohen's d.\n\nThis method calculates the correlation between one categorical feature and one numerical feature by \nperforming an independent t-test and calculating Cohen's d to determine the effect size.

### Tool: `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/COMPAS_cleaned.csv", "column_cat": "MaritalStatus", "column_num": "DecileScore"}`
- **Log:** I need to correct the input format for the tool to analyze the correlation using Cohen's D. Let's try again with the correct parameters.

Action: categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/COMPAS_cleaned.csv", "column_cat": "MaritalStatus", "column_num": "DecileScore"}
- **Result:** `{'error': 'The categorical feature must have exactly two categories.'}`

---

### Tool: `categorical_numerical_correlation_standardized_difference`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/COMPAS_cleaned.csv", "column_cat": "MaritalStatus", "column_num": "DecileScore"}`
- **Log:** The error indicates that the "MaritalStatus" feature does not have exactly two categories, which is a requirement for using Cohen's D. To proceed, I will need to use a different method that can handle categorical features with more than two categories. I will use the Standardized Difference method instead, which can handle multiple categories.

Action: categorical_numerical_correlation_standardized_difference
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/COMPAS_cleaned.csv", "column_cat": "MaritalStatus", "column_num": "DecileScore"}
- **Result:** `{'Standardized_Difference_First_Category': -0.5508903028123346}`

---

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "The analysis of the COMPAS dataset focused on detecting any hidden influence of marital status on assessment outcomes. The relevant features analyzed were 'MaritalStatus,' 'ScoreText,' and 'DecileScore.' The correlation analysis revealed a low bias (Level 2) between 'MaritalStatus' and 'ScoreText,' and a moderate bias (Level 3) between 'MaritalStatus' and 'DecileScore.' Overall, the influence of marital status on the dataset is categorized as a moderate bias (Level 3). This suggests that while marital status has a minor impact on score text, it has a more significant effect on decile scores, which could influence assessment decisions. The findings highlight the importance of considering demographic factors like marital status in the assessment process to ensure fairness and accuracy."}`
- **Log:** The Standardized Difference for the first category of "MaritalStatus" with respect to "DecileScore" is approximately -0.551. According to the bias evaluation criteria for Standardized Difference:
- Standardized Difference < 0.25: Level 1 (No bias)
- 0.25 <= Standardized Difference < 0.5: Level 2 (Low bias)
- 0.5 <= Standardized Difference < 0.75: Level 3 (Moderate bias)
- 0.75 <= Standardized Difference < 1.0: Level 4 (High bias)
- Standardized Difference >= 1.0: Level 5 (Extreme bias)

A Standardized Difference of -0.551 indicates a Level 3 bias, which suggests a moderate correlation between "MaritalStatus" and "DecileScore."

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** "MaritalStatus," "ScoreText," "DecileScore"
3. **Bias Levels:**
   - **MaritalStatus vs. ScoreText:** Level 2 (Low bias)
   - **MaritalStatus vs. DecileScore:** Level 3 (Moderate bias)
4. **Overall Bias Level:** Level 3 (Moderate bias)

### Explanation:

- The analysis revealed a low correlation between "MaritalStatus" and "ScoreText," indicating that marital status has a minor influence on the score text assigned to individuals.
- However, there is a moderate correlation between "MaritalStatus" and "DecileScore," suggesting that marital status has a more noticeable impact on the decile score, which could affect the assessment outcomes.
- The overall bias level is categorized as Level 3, indicating a moderate influence of marital status on the assessment results.

I will now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.
