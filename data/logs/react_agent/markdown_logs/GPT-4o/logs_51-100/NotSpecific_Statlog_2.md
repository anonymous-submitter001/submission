## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the Statlog dataset indicates a low level of bias in the relationship between housing circumstances and credit risk classification. The Cramér's V value suggests a weak association, while the Statistical Parity analysis shows no significant bias. The Total Variation analysis reveals a slight difference in distribution, but it is not substantial. Overall, the bias level is categorized as Level 2 (Low bias), indicating that housing circumstances do not significantly influence credit risk outcomes. A detailed report has been generated and saved as "Bias_Detection_Report_Statlog.pdf" in the "generated_files" folder.

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/Housing_CreditRisk.csv"}`
- **Log:** The relevant columns 'Housing' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)' have been successfully extracted into a new dataset named "Housing_CreditRisk.csv". Now, I will proceed with the detection and analysis of bias using categorical-categorical correlation methods.

**Detection and Analysis Methods:**

1. **Cramér's V**: This method will help us understand the strength of association between the 'Housing' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)' features.

2. **Statistical Parity**: This method will assess whether the distribution of 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)' is independent of the 'Housing' feature.

3. **Total Variation**: This method will measure the difference in distributions between the two features.

I will start by applying Cramér's V to the dataset.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/Housing_CreditRisk.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v: ['file_path', 'column_a', 'column_b']", 'tool_description': "Perform correlation bias analysis on two specified categorical columns using Cramér's V.\n\nThis method calculates Cramér's V to measure the association between two categorical variables\nbased on the chi-square statistic.

- **Log:** I need to provide the required parameters for the Cramér's V analysis, including the file path and the names of the two columns. Let's specify these parameters correctly.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/Housing_CreditRisk.csv", "column_a": "Housing", "column_b": "Credit risk (Good/Bad)"}
- **Result:** `{'Cramers_V': 0.13490678849696044}`

---

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/Housing_CreditRisk.csv"}`
- **Log:** The Cramér's V value for the correlation between 'Housing' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)' is approximately 0.135. According to the bias level categorization for Cramér's V:

- Cramér's V < 0.1: Level 1 (No bias)
- 0.1 <= Cramér's V < 0.3: Level 2 (Low bias)
- 0.3 <= Cramér's V < 0.5: Level 3 (Moderate bias)
- 0.5 <= Cramér's V < 0.7: Level 4 (High bias)
- Cramér's V >= 0.7: Level 5 (Extreme bias)

The Cramér's V value of 0.135 indicates a Level 2 bias, which is considered low. This suggests a weak association between 'Housing' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)'.

Next, I will apply the Statistical Parity method to further assess the bias.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity
Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/Housing_CreditRisk.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity: ['file_path', 'column_x', 'column_y']", 'tool_description': 'Perform correlation bias analysis on two specified categorical columns using statistical parity and Z-scores.\n\nThis method calculates the Z-scores for differences in proportions between groups defined by \nfeature X on feature Y, based on statistical parity.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/Housing_CreditRisk.csv", "column_x": "Housing", "column_y": "Credit risk (Good/Bad)"}
- **Result:** `{'Max_Z_value': 0.23438162035080876}`

---

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_total_variation`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/Housing_CreditRisk.csv", "column_a": "Housing", "column_b": "Credit risk (Good/Bad)"}`
- **Log:** The Statistical Parity analysis resulted in a maximum Z-value of approximately 0.234. According to the bias level categorization for Statistical Parity:

- Max Z-value <= 0.25: Level 1 (No bias)
- 0.25 < Max Z-value <= 0.50: Level 2 (Low bias)
- 0.50 < Max Z-value <= 0.75: Level 3 (Moderate bias)
- 0.75 < Max Z-value <= 1.00: Level 4 (High bias)
- Max Z-value > 1.00: Level 5 (Extreme bias)

The maximum Z-value of 0.234 indicates a Level 1 bias, which suggests no significant bias in terms of statistical parity between 'Housing' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)'.

Finally, I will apply the Total Variation method to complete the analysis.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_total_variation
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/Housing_CreditRisk.csv", "column_a": "Housing", "column_b": "Credit risk (Good/Bad)"}

- **Result:** `{'Max_Total_Variation_Distance': 0.1074074074074074}`

---

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "The analysis of the Statlog dataset indicates a low level of bias in the relationship between housing circumstances and credit risk classification. The Cramér's V value suggests a weak association, while the Statistical Parity analysis shows no significant bias. The Total Variation analysis reveals a slight difference in distribution, but it is not substantial. Overall, the bias level is categorized as Level 2 (Low bias), indicating that housing circumstances do not significantly influence credit risk outcomes."}`
- **Log:** The Total Variation analysis resulted in a maximum Total Variation Distance of approximately 0.107. According to the bias level categorization for Total Variation:

- Max TVD <= 0.1: Level 1 (No bias)
- 0.1 < Max TVD <= 0.2: Level 2 (Low bias)
- 0.2 < Max TVD <= 0.3: Level 3 (Moderate bias)
- 0.3 < Max TVD <= 0.4: Level 4 (High bias)
- Max TVD > 0.4: Level 5 (Extreme bias)

The maximum Total Variation Distance of 0.107 indicates a Level 2 bias, which is considered low. This suggests a slight difference in the distribution of 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)' across different 'Housing' categories.

**Summary of Findings:**

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** 'Housing' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)'
3. **Bias Levels:**
   - **Cramér's V:** Level 2 (Low bias)
   - **Statistical Parity:** Level 1 (No bias)
   - **Total Variation:** Level 2 (Low bias)

4. **Overall Bias Level:** Considering the results from all methods, the overall bias level is determined to be Level 2 (Low bias).

5. **Additional Explanation:** 
   - The Cramér's V analysis indicates a weak association between 'Housing' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)', suggesting that housing circumstances have a minor influence on credit risk classification.
   - The Statistical Parity analysis shows no significant bias, indicating that the distribution of credit risk is fairly independent of housing categories.
   - The Total Variation analysis reveals a slight difference in distribution, suggesting that while there is some variation, it is not substantial.

**Conclusion:** The analysis suggests that there is a low level of bias in the relationship between housing circumstances and credit risk classification in the dataset. This indicates that housing circumstances do not significantly influence credit risk outcomes.

I will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.
