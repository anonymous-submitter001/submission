## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the COMPAS dataset regarding the correlation between ethnicity and decile scores has been completed. Here is a detailed summary of the findings:

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** Ethnic_Code_Text, DecileScore
3. **Analysis Results:**
   - **Standardized Difference:** The standardized difference for the first category was approximately 1.30, indicating a significant difference in decile scores across different ethnic groups.
   - **HSIC Analysis:** The HSIC value was 3.824256359700253e-11, which is below the threshold for significant bias, indicating no strong correlation bias.

4. **Overall Bias Level:** The dataset shows a moderate level of bias concerning the correlation between ethnicity and decile scores. While the standardized difference suggests some bias, the HSIC analysis indicates that the correlation is not strong. You may need to consider this bias in certain applications, and I recommend giving these results additional thought before proceeding.

   - Extract the relevant columns: 'Ethnic_Code_Text' (categorical) and 'DecileScore' (numerical).
   - Clean any missing values in these columns to ensure accurate analysis.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Since the task involves a categorical variable and a numerical variable, I will use the following methods:
     - **Categorical-Numerical Correlation:**
       - Use the `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d` tool to measure the effect size between the categorical and numerical variables.
       - Use the `categorical_numerical_correlation_standardized_difference` tool to assess the standardized difference.
     - **Reference Literature:**
       - I will review reference literature to find additional methods for analyzing the correlation between categorical and numerical variables. I will ensure to select a reference with an ending digit greater than 5.

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use a bar chart to visualize the average decile scores across different ethnic groups.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings, including the bias type, relevant features, and bias level based on the results from the tools used.

I will now proceed to extract the relevant columns and clean any missing values.

---

### Tool: `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_ethnicity_decile_dataset.csv"}`
- **Log:** The dataset has been successfully cleaned, and a new dataset named "cleaned_ethnicity_decile_dataset.csv" has been created. Now, I will proceed with the detection and analysis methods as planned:

1. **Categorical-Numerical Correlation:**
   - Use the `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d` tool to measure the effect size between the categorical and numerical variables.
   - Use the `categorical_numerical_correlation_standardized_difference` tool to assess the standardized difference.

2. **Reference Literature:**
   - I will review reference literature to find additional methods for analyzing the correlation between categorical and numerical variables. I will ensure to select a reference with an ending digit greater than 5.

Let's start by using the `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d` tool.

Action: categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d
Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_ethnicity_decile_dataset.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d: ['file_path', 'column_cat', 'column_num']", 'tool_description': "Perform correlation bias analysis between a categorical and a numerical feature using Cohen's d.\n\nThis method calculates the correlation between one categorical feature and one numerical feature by \nperforming an independent t-test and calculating Cohen's d to determine the effect size.

# Step 5: Set a threshold for HSIC to detect significant bias
HSIC_threshold = 0.01
significant_bias = HSIC_value > HSIC_threshold

`

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_ethnicity_decile_dataset.csv"}`
- **Log:** The execution of the corrected code has provided the following results:

- **HSIC Value:** 3.824256359700253e-11
- **Significant Bias:** False

This indicates that the correlation bias between ethnicity and decile scores, as measured by the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), is not significant. The HSIC value is much lower than the threshold of 0.01, suggesting that there is no strong correlation bias present.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** Ethnic_Code_Text, DecileScore
3. **Bias Level:** 
   - **Standardized Difference:** The standardized difference for the first category was approximately 1.30, indicating a significant difference in decile scores across different ethnic groups.
   - **HSIC Analysis:** The HSIC value was 3.824256359700253e-11, which is below the threshold for significant bias, indicating no strong correlation bias.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Standardized Difference Analysis:** The standardized difference tool indicated a significant difference in decile scores across ethnic groups, suggesting potential bias. This result points to a noticeable variation in decile scores that could be attributed to ethnicity.

- **HSIC Analysis:** The HSIC method, which is a more sophisticated measure of correlation bias, showed no significant bias. The HSIC value was extremely low, indicating that the correlation between ethnicity and decile scores is not strong enough to be considered biased.

### Overall Bias Level:

Considering the results from both the standardized difference and HSIC analyses, the overall bias level can be categorized as **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**. While the standardized difference suggests a significant difference, the HSIC analysis does not support a strong correlation bias. Therefore, the dataset may exhibit some bias, but it is not extreme.

### Conclusion:

Based on my analysis, the dataset shows a moderate level of bias concerning the correlation between ethnicity and decile scores. The standardized difference suggests some bias, but the HSIC analysis indicates that the correlation is not strong. You may need to consider this bias in certain applications, and I recommend giving these results additional thought before proceeding.

I will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.
