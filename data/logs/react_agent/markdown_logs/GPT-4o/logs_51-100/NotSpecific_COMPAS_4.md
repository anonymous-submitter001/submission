## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the COMPAS dataset reveals significant biases related to the 'Language' feature. The distribution of languages is highly imbalanced, indicating extreme bias (Level 5). There is a low correlation between 'Language' and 'Ethnic_Code_Text' (Level 2), suggesting some relationship between language and ethnicity. A high correlation exists between 'Language' and 'RecSupervisionLevel' (Level 4), indicating language significantly impacts the recommended supervision level. No significant correlation is found between 'Language' and 'ScoreText' (Level 1). Overall, the bias level is categorized as Level 4 due to the extreme distribution bias and high correlation with supervision level. A detailed detection report has been successfully created and saved as "generated_files/COMPAS_Bias_Report.pdf".

- 0.3 <= Cramér's V < 0.5: Level 3
- 0.5 <= Cramér's V < 0.7: Level 4
- Cramér's V >= 0.7: Level 5

The correlation falls into Level 2, indicating a low level of association between 'Language' and 'Ethnic_Code_Text'. This suggests that while there is some relationship between language and ethnicity, it is not very strong.

Next, I will proceed with the correlation analysis between 'Language' and the numerical features 'RecSupervisionLevel' and 'ScoreText'.

### Correlation Analysis Plan:
1. Use categorical-numerical correlation methods to explore relationships between 'Language' and 'RecSupervisionLevel'.
2. Use categorical-numerical correlation methods to explore relationships between 'Language' and 'ScoreText'.

5. **Overall Bias Level:**
   - Considering the extreme bias in the distribution of 'Language' and the high correlation with 'RecSupervisionLevel', the overall bias level can be categorized as Level 4.

I will now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.

Action: generate_bias_report_pdf
Action Input: {"tool_input": "The analysis of the COMPAS dataset reveals significant biases related to the 'Language' feature. The distribution of languages is highly imbalanced, indicating extreme bias (Level 5). There is a low correlation between 'Language' and 'Ethnic_Code_Text' (Level 2), suggesting some relationship between language and ethnicity. A high correlation exists between 'Language' and 'RecSupervisionLevel' (Level 4), indicating language significantly impacts the recommended supervision level. No significant correlation is found between 'Language' and 'ScoreText' (Level 1). Overall, the bias level is categorized as Level 4 due to the extreme distribution bias and high correlation with supervision level."}

Final Answer: The analysis of the COMPAS dataset reveals significant biases related to the 'Language' feature. The distribution of languages is highly imbalanced, indicating extreme bias (Level 5). There is a low correlation between 'Language' and 'Ethnic_Code_Text' (Level 2), suggesting some relationship between language and ethnicity. A high correlation exists between 'Language' and 'RecSupervisionLevel' (Level 4), indicating language significantly impacts the recommended supervision level. No significant correlation is found between 'Language' and 'ScoreText' (Level 1). Overall, the bias level is categorized as Level 4 due to the extreme distribution bias and high correlation with supervision level. A detailed detection report has been generated.
