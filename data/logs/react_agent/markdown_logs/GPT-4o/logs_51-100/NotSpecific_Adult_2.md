## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the dataset "source_files/Adult.csv" focused on detecting unintended biases related to educational attainment. The correlation analysis using Cramér's V between 'education' and 'income' revealed a moderate level of association with a Cramér's V value of 0.369. This suggests that educational attainment has a moderate impact on income levels, indicating a potential bias in income opportunities based on education. The overall bias level is categorized as Level 3, indicating a moderate bias. Further analysis considering other demographic factors is recommended to fully understand the implications of this bias. A detailed detection report has been generated and saved as "generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf".

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_education_data.csv", "column_a": " education", "column_b": " income"}`
- **Log:** The error indicates that 'education-num' is not a categorical feature, which makes sense as it is a numerical representation of education levels. I should instead focus on analyzing the correlation between 'education' and other categorical features in the dataset. I will proceed by identifying another categorical feature to analyze with 'education'. 

Let's consider the 'income' feature, which is categorical, to analyze its correlation with 'education'. 

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_education_data.csv", "column_a": " education", "column_b": " income"}
- **Result:** `{'error': 'Columns  education or  income do not exist in the dataset.'}`

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_education_data.csv", "column_a": "education", "column_b": "income"}`
- **Log:** It seems there is an issue with the column names due to leading spaces. I will trim the spaces and try again to perform the correlation analysis between 'education' and 'income'. 

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_education_data.csv", "column_a": "education", "column_b": "income"}

---

### Tool: `get_csv_features`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_education_data.csv"}`
- **Log:** I need to ensure that the column names are correctly specified without leading spaces. I will re-examine the dataset to confirm the exact column names and retry the correlation analysis. 

Action: get_csv_features
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_education_data.csv"}
- **Result:** `Successfully read the CSV file. The features are:

---

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "source_files/Adult.csv", "column_a": " education", "column_b": " income"}`
- **Log:** It seems that the dataset "cleaned_education_data.csv" only contains the columns 'education' and 'education-num'. To analyze the correlation between 'education' and 'income', I need to work with the original dataset "source_files/Adult.csv" where the 'income' column is present. I will proceed to perform the correlation analysis between 'education' and 'income' using the original dataset.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"file_path": "source_files/Adult.csv", "column_a": " education", "column_b": " income"}
- **Result:** `{'Cramers_V': 0.3688382910002382}`

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "The analysis of the dataset 'source_files/Adult.csv' focused on detecting unintended biases related to educational attainment. The correlation analysis using Cramér's V between 'education' and 'income' revealed a moderate level of association with a Cramér's V value of 0.369. This suggests that educational attainment has a moderate impact on income levels, indicating a potential bias in income opportunities based on education. The overall bias level is categorized as Level 3, indicating a moderate bias. Further analysis considering other demographic factors is recommended to fully understand the implications of this bias."}`
- **Log:** The Cramér's V value for the correlation between 'education' and 'income' is approximately 0.369. This indicates a moderate level of association between these two categorical variables.

### Summary of Findings:
1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** 'education', 'income'
3. **Bias Level:** Level 3 (Moderate Bias)
   - A Cramér's V value between 0.3 and 0.5 indicates a moderate level of association, suggesting that educational attainment has a moderate impact on income levels in the dataset.
4. **Additional Explanation:** 
   - The analysis reveals that there is a moderate correlation between educational attainment and income, which suggests that individuals with different levels of education may experience different income levels. This could indicate potential biases in how educational attainment affects income opportunities.
   - It is important to consider this correlation in the context of other demographic factors to fully understand the extent and implications of this bias.

### Overall Bias Level:
- The overall bias level related to educational attainment in terms of its correlation with income is categorized as Level 3, indicating a moderate bias.

I will now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{
    "content_sections": [
        {"type": "text", "content": "The analysis of the dataset 'source_files/Adult.csv' focused on detecting unintended biases related to educational attainment."},
        {"type": "text", "content": "The correlation analysis using Cramér's V between 'education' and 'income' revealed a moderate level of association with a Cramér's V value of 0.369."},
        {"type": "text", "content": "This suggests that educational attainment has a moderate impact on income levels, indicating a potential bias in income opportunities based on education."},
        {"type": "text", "content": "The overall bias level is categorized as Level 3, indicating a moderate bias."},
        {"type": "text", "content": "Further analysis considering other demographic factors is recommended to fully understand the implications of this bias."}
    ],
    "output_pdf_path": "generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf"
}`
- **Log:** I need to correct the input format for generating the PDF report. I will specify the content sections and the output PDF path correctly.
