## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The bias detection task has been successfully completed. We analyzed the correlation between the school a student attends and their final grade. The findings indicate minimal bias, with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.145 and a standardized difference of 0.025. These results suggest that the school attended has a minimal impact on the final grade, and the dataset is suitable for use with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios. A detailed report has been generated and saved as "bias_detection_report.pdf" in the "generated_files" folder. If you have any additional needs or tasks, please let me know.

### Tool: `extract_two_columns`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "source_files/Student Performance.csv", "columns": ["school", "G3"]}`
- **Log:** The dataset has been successfully loaded, and it contains 395 rows and 33 columns. The relevant features for the user's task are likely "school" and "G3" (final grade). The task is to determine if there is a correlation between the school a student attends and their final grade. 

Next, I will formulate a plan to execute this task:

1. **Understanding and Preprocessing the Dataset:**
   - Extract the relevant columns: "school" and "G3".
   - Clean any missing values in these columns to ensure accurate analysis.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Since "school" is a categorical variable and "G3" is a numerical variable, I will use the "categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d" tool to measure the effect size and determine if there is a significant correlation between the school attended and the final grade.
   - Additionally, I will use the "categorical_numerical_correlation_standardized_difference" tool to further analyze the correlation.

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use a bar chart to visualize the average final grade for each school to provide a clear visual representation of any differences.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings based on the results from the correlation tools and the visualization.

I will now proceed with extracting the relevant columns and cleaning any missing values.

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_school_final_grade.csv"}`
- **Log:** The bar chart has been successfully created and saved, providing a visual representation of the average final grade for each school. Now, I will summarize the findings and generate a detailed report.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** School, Final Grade (G3)
3. **Bias Level:** 
   - **Cohen's d Effect Size:** 0.145, indicating a very small effect size and suggesting minimal bias.
   - **Standardized Difference:** 0.025, further supporting the finding of minimal bias.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Level 2 (Minimal Bias):** 
  Based on my analysis, the school a student attends exhibits no notable bias in affecting their final grade. The results from the tools I used indicate slight variations in certain metrics. For instance, Cohen's d returned a value of 0.145, and the standardized difference was 0.025. While the bias is minor, the dataset is still suitable for use, with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.

### Additional Explanation:

The analysis shows that the school attended has a minimal impact on the final grade, as evidenced by the small effect size and standardized difference. This suggests that other factors may play a more significant role in determining student performance.

I will now generate a detailed detection report.
