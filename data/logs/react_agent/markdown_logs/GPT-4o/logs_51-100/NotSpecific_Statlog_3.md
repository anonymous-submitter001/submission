## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the "Job" feature in the dataset "Statlog_cleaned.csv" indicates a moderate level of distribution bias. The balance metric is approximately 0.71, corresponding to a bias level of 3, which signifies a moderate bias in the distribution of job categories. The Shannon entropy is approximately 1.41, providing insight into the distribution's uncertainty. A bar chart visualization has been created to illustrate the distribution of job categories. The overall bias level is categorized as Level 3, indicating moderate bias. A detailed report has been generated and saved as a PDF, which you can access [here](generated_files/Job_Bias_Detection_Report.pdf).
