Next, I will formulate a plan to execute the bias detection task. This will involve:

1. **Understanding and Preprocessing the Dataset:**
   - Extract the "Property" feature and any other relevant features for analysis.
   - Clean the data to handle any missing values.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Analyze the distribution of the "Property" feature to detect any distribution bias.
   - Check for correlations between the "Property" feature and other features to detect correlation bias.

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use bar charts or pie charts to visualize the distribution of the "Property" feature.
   - Use heatmaps to visualize correlations between features.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings, specifying the type of bias, relevant features, bias level, and additional explanations.

### Tool: `_Exception`
- **Input:** `Invalid or incomplete response`
- **Log:** Parsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: The analysis of the correlation between the "Property" and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)" features using CramÃ©r's V has been completed. The CramÃ©r's V value is approximately 0.154, which falls into Level 2 according to the bias evaluation thresholds. This suggests a low level of correlation bias between these two features.

Now, I will summarize the findings and generate a detailed report.

1. **Bias Type:** 
   - Distribution and Correlation

2. **Relevant Feature(s):** 
   - Property
   - Credit risk (Good/Bad)

3. **Bias Level:**
   - Distribution Bias Level: Level 1 (No significant distribution bias)
   - Correlation Bias Level: Level 2 (Low correlation bias)

4. **Explanation of Findings:**
   - **Distribution Bias:** The "Property" feature has a normalized entropy of approximately 0.97, indicating a well-balanced distribution with no significant bias.
   - **Correlation Bias:** The correlation between "Property" and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)" is low, with a CramÃ©r's V value of approximately 0.154. This suggests a weak association, indicating a low level of bias.

5. **Overall Bias Level:** 
   - Considering both distribution and correlation analyses, the overall bias level is Level 1, indicating no significant bias related to the type of property someone owns in the dataset.

I will now generate a detailed detection report in PDF format.

Explanation of Findings: The 'Property' feature has a normalized entropy of approximately 0.97, indicating a well-balanced distribution with no significant bias. The correlation between 'Property' and 'Credit risk (Good/Bad)' is low, with a CramÃ©r's V value of approximately 0.154, suggesting a weak association and a low level of bias."},
