## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the "Telephone" feature in the dataset "Statlog_cleaned.csv" indicates no significant bias. The distribution is well-balanced, and there is no significant correlation with "Credit risk (Good/Bad)". The overall bias level is Level 1, meaning no significant bias was detected. A detailed report has been generated and saved as "generated_files/Telephone_Bias_Report.pdf".

1. **Understanding and Preprocessing the Dataset:**
   - Load the dataset and identify the relevant feature(s) for analysis, which in this case is "Telephone."
   - Clean the dataset to handle any missing values.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - **Distribution Analysis:** Examine the distribution of the "Telephone" feature to understand its balance within the dataset.
   - **Correlation Analysis:** Investigate if there is any correlation between the "Telephone" feature and other relevant features, such as "Credit risk (Good/Bad)."

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use bar charts or pie charts to visualize the distribution of the "Telephone" feature.
   - Use heatmaps to visualize any correlations between "Telephone" and other features.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings, specifying the type of bias, relevant features, bias level, and provide detailed explanations.

I will start by cleaning the dataset to handle any missing values.
