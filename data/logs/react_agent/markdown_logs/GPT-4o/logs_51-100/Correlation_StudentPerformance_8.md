## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the "Student Performance" dataset focused on detecting bias in the correlation between student activities and father's occupation. The relevant features analyzed were 'activities' (student activities) and 'Fjob' (father's occupation). The methods used included Cram√©r's V and Statistical Parity, both of which indicated a Level 1 bias, meaning no significant bias was detected. The overall bias level is also Level 1, suggesting a balanced distribution of student activities across different father's occupations. A detailed detection report has been generated and saved as a PDF, which you can find at: generated_files/bias_detection_report_student_performance.pdf.

   - Load the dataset and extract the relevant columns: 'activities' and 'Fjob'.
   - Clean the data by handling any missing values in these columns.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Use categorical-categorical correlation methods to analyze the relationship between 'activities' and 'Fjob'.
   - Specifically, apply methods like Cram√©r's V and Statistical Parity to assess the correlation.

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Create visualizations such as bar charts or heatmaps to illustrate the distribution and correlation between the two features.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings, specifying the type of bias, relevant features, bias level, and provide a detailed explanation of the results.

Next, I will proceed with the extraction and cleaning of the relevant columns.

- **Log:** The dataset has been successfully cleaned, and a new dataset has been created. Now, I will proceed with the correlation analysis between the 'activities' and 'Fjob' columns using categorical-categorical correlation methods such as Cram√©r's V and Statistical Parity.

### Detection and Analysis:

1. **Cram√©r's V:**
   - This method will help assess the strength of association between the two categorical variables.

2. **Statistical Parity:**

Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/cleaned_activities_fjob_dataset.csv"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v: ['file_path', 'column_a', 'column_b']", 'tool_description': "Perform correlation bias analysis on two specified categorical columns using Cram√©r's V.\n\nThis method calculates Cram√©r's V to measure the association between two categorical variables\nbased on the chi-square statistic.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_activities_fjob_dataset.csv", "column_a": "activities", "column_b": "Fjob"}

### Tool: `categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_activities_fjob_dataset.csv", "column_a": "activities", "column_b": "Fjob"}`
- **Log:** The Cram√©r's V value is 0.074, which indicates a very weak association between the 'activities' and 'Fjob' columns. According to the bias level categorization for Cram√©r's V, this falls into Level 1, representing no significant bias.

Next, I will apply the Statistical Parity method to further analyze the distribution of student activities across different father's occupations.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_activities_fjob_dataset.csv", "column_a": "activities", "column_b": "Fjob"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity: ['column_x', 'column_y']", 'tool_description': 'Perform correlation bias analysis on two specified categorical columns using statistical parity and Z-scores.\n\nThis method calculates the Z-scores for differences in proportions between groups defined by \nfeature X on feature Y, based on statistical parity.

- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_activities_fjob_dataset.csv", "column_x": "activities", "column_y": "Fjob"}`
- **Log:** I need to provide the correct parameters for applying the Statistical Parity method. I will specify the file path and the column names for 'activities' and 'Fjob'.

Action: categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_activities_fjob_dataset.csv", "column_x": "activities", "column_y": "Fjob"}
- **Result:** `{'Max_Z_value': 0.07472829585410853}`

---

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "The analysis of the dataset 'Student Performance.csv' focused on detecting bias in the correlation between student activities and father's occupation. The relevant features analyzed were 'activities' and 'Fjob'. The methods used included Cram√©r's V and Statistical Parity, both of which indicated a Level 1 bias, meaning no significant bias was detected. The overall bias level is also Level 1, suggesting a balanced distribution of student activities across different father's occupations."}`
- **Log:** The Statistical Parity method yielded a maximum Z-value of 0.0747, which indicates a very low level of disparity in the distribution of student activities across different father's occupations. According to the bias level categorization for Statistical Parity, this falls into Level 1, representing no significant bias.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** 'activities' (student activities) and 'Fjob' (father's occupation)
3. **Bias Level:**
   - **Cram√©r's V:** Level 1 (No significant bias)
   - **Statistical Parity:** Level 1 (No significant bias)
4. **Overall Bias Level:** Level 1 (No significant bias)

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Cram√©r's V Analysis:** The Cram√©r's V value of 0.074 indicates a very weak association between student activities and father's occupation. This suggests that there is no significant correlation between these two features, and the distribution of student activities is not strongly influenced by the father's occupation.

- **Statistical Parity Analysis:** The maximum Z-value of 0.0747 further supports the finding that there is no significant disparity in the distribution of student activities across different father's occupations. This means that the likelihood of a student participating in activities is fairly consistent regardless of their father's job type.

Overall, the analysis indicates that there is no significant bias or correlation between student activities and father's occupation in the dataset. The findings suggest that student participation in activities is not influenced by the father's occupation, and the distribution is balanced across different job types.

I will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.

- **Log:** I need to provide the correct parameters for generating the PDF report. I will specify the content sections and the output PDF path.

Action: generate_bias_report_pdf
