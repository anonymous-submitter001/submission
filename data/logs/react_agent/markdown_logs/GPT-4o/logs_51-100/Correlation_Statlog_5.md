## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the dataset "Statlog.csv" focused on determining the correlation between "Installment rate in percentage of disposable income" and "Personal status and sex" to identify potential bias in loan structuring. The standardized difference method was used, revealing a minimal bias level. The standardized difference value was approximately -0.144, indicating slight variations in metrics but not significant enough to impact the dataset's usability. The dataset can be used with confidence, though minor attention may be needed in specific scenarios. A detailed bias detection report has been generated and saved as "generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf". If you have any additional needs or tasks, please let me know.

- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_Statlog.csv", "column_cat": "Personal status and sex", "column_num": "Installment rate in percentage of disposable income"}`
- **Log:** The "Personal status and sex" column contains more than two categories: 'male : single', 'female : divorced/separated/married', 'male : divorced/separated', and 'male : married/widowed'. This means the Cohen's d method is not applicable as it requires exactly two categories. Instead, I will use a different method suitable for categorical features with more than two categories.

**Revised Plan:**

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing:**
   - Already completed: Loaded the dataset, identified relevant features, and cleaned missing values.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Use the `categorical_numerical_correlation_standardized_difference` tool to analyze the correlation between the categorical feature with multiple categories and the numerical feature.

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use a bar chart to visualize the distribution of "Installment rate in percentage of disposable income" across different categories of "Personal status and sex".

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings based on the results from the correlation analysis tools and visualization.
   - Determine the bias level based on the evaluation metrics from the tools used.

I will proceed with the standardized difference method for correlation analysis.
