## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the dataset 'Adult_cleaned.csv' focused on detecting potential biases related to the 'age' feature. The investigation included both correlation and distribution bias analyses. The correlation analysis between age and other numerical features ('fnlwgt', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week') revealed very weak correlations, all falling into Level 1 bias, indicating no significant correlation bias. The distribution analysis of age showed a slight positive skew with a skewness value of 0.559, categorized as Level 2 bias, suggesting a moderate distribution bias. However, the kurtosis value of -0.166 indicated a platykurtic distribution, falling into Level 1 bias, suggesting no significant bias in terms of the distribution's peakedness. Overall, the age feature exhibits a Level 2 bias, primarily due to the slight skewness in its distribution. The detailed bias detection report has been successfully created and saved as a PDF at: generated_files/Bias_Detection_Report_Adult_cleaned.pdf.

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_skewness`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/Adult_cleaned.csv", "column": "age"}`
- **Log:** The 'workclass' feature has more than two categories, which is not suitable for Cohen's d analysis. I will need to choose a different method or feature for analyzing the correlation between age and categorical features. I will proceed with analyzing the distribution bias of age across different categories using skewness and kurtosis.

### Plan for Distribution Bias Analysis:
1. Calculate skewness of the age distribution.
2. Calculate kurtosis of the age distribution.

I will start by calculating the skewness of the age distribution.

Action: numerical_distribution_skewness
Action Input: {"tool_input": "generated_files/Adult_cleaned.csv", "column": "age"}
- **Result:** `{'error': "Missing required parameters for numerical_distribution_skewness: ['file_path', 'column_name']", 'tool_description': 'Perform distribution bias analysis on a specified numerical column using skewness.\n\nThis method calculates the skewness of the numerical column to assess the distribution bias. \nBased on the skewness value, the bias is categorized into different levels:\n    - Absolute Skewness < 0.5: Level 1\n    - 0.5 <= Absolute Skewness < 0.8: Level 2\n    - 0.8 <= Absolute Skewness < 0.9: Level 3\n    - 0.9 <= Absolute Skewness < 1: Level 4\n    - Absolute Skewness >= 1: Level 5\n\nArgs:\n    file_path (str): The path to the CSV file to read.\n    column_name (str): The name of the numerical column to analyze.\n\nReturns:\n    dict: A dictionary containing the skewness value of the column,\n          or an error message if the process failed.'}`

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_skewness`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/Adult_cleaned.csv", "column_name": "age"}`
- **Log:** I need to specify the correct parameters for the skewness analysis, including the file path and the column name. I will proceed with calculating the skewness for the 'age' column.

Action: numerical_distribution_skewness
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/Adult_cleaned.csv", "column_name": "age"}
- **Result:** `{'Skewness': 0.5587433694130484}`

---

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_kurtosis`
- **Input:** `{"file_path": "generated_files/Adult_cleaned.csv", "column_name": "age"}`
- **Log:** The skewness of the age distribution is approximately 0.559. This indicates a moderate positive skew, which falls into Level 2 bias, suggesting a slight distribution bias in the age data.

Next, I will calculate the kurtosis of the age distribution to further analyze the distribution bias.

Action: numerical_distribution_kurtosis
Action Input: {"file_path": "generated_files/Adult_cleaned.csv", "column_name": "age"}
- **Result:** `{'Kurtosis': -0.16612745957143904}`

### Tool: `_Exception`
- **Input:** `Invalid or incomplete response`
- **Log:** Parsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: The kurtosis of the age distribution is approximately -0.166. This indicates a platykurtic distribution, which is relatively flat compared to a normal distribution. This falls into Level 1 bias, suggesting no significant distribution bias in terms of kurtosis for the age data.

### Summary of Distribution Bias Analysis:
- **Skewness of Age:** Skewness = 0.559 (Level 2 bias)
- **Kurtosis of Age:** Kurtosis = -0.166 (Level 1 bias)

The age distribution shows a slight positive skew, indicating a moderate distribution bias, but the kurtosis suggests no significant bias in terms of the distribution's peakedness.

### Overall Bias Level:
Based on the analyses conducted, the overall bias level related to age in the dataset is determined to be Level 2. This is due to the slight distribution bias indicated by the skewness of the age data, while other analyses suggest no significant correlation or distribution biases.

### Detailed Summary:
1. **Bias Type:** Both "Correlation" and "Distribution" biases were analyzed.
2. **Relevant Feature(s):** Age was analyzed in relation to 'fnlwgt', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week', and its own distribution.
3. **Bias Level:** 
   - Correlation Bias: Level 1 (No significant correlation bias with other numerical features)
   - Distribution Bias: Level 2 (Slight skewness in age distribution)
4. **Additional Explanation:** 
   - The correlation analysis between age and other numerical features showed very weak correlations, indicating no significant correlation bias.
   - The distribution analysis revealed a slight positive skew in the age data, suggesting a moderate distribution bias, but the kurtosis indicated no significant bias in terms of the distribution's peakedness.
5. **Overall Bias Level:** Level 2

I will now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.
