## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the dataset regarding the impact of being in a romantic relationship on students reveals the following:

1. **Bias Type:** The analysis involves both correlation and distribution biases.

2. **Relevant Features:** The features analyzed include 'romantic', 'G1', 'G2', 'G3' (academic performance), and 'goout', 'freetime', 'Dalc', 'Walc' (social activities).

3. **Bias Level:**
   - Correlation between 'romantic' and 'G1': Level 1 (No significant bias)
   - Correlation between 'romantic' and 'G2': Level 1 (No significant bias)
   - Correlation between 'romantic' and 'G3': Level 2 (Small bias)
   - Distribution of 'goout': Level 1 (No significant skewness)
   - Distribution of 'freetime': Level 1 (No significant skewness)
   - Distribution of 'Dalc': Level 5 (Highly skewed)
   - Distribution of 'Walc': Level 2 (Moderately skewed)

4. **Additional Explanation:** The analysis indicates that being in a romantic relationship does not significantly impact academic performance ('G1', 'G2', 'G3'), as the bias levels are low (Level 1 and Level 2). The distribution of social activities such as 'goout' and 'freetime' is fairly symmetrical, indicating no significant bias. However, the 'Dalc' feature shows a high level of skewness, indicating a significant bias in weekday alcohol consumption. The 'Walc' feature shows moderate skewness, indicating a small bias in weekend alcohol consumption.

5. **Overall Bias Level:** Considering both correlation and distribution analyses, the overall bias level is Level 2, indicating a small bias primarily due to the skewness in alcohol consumption features.

### Tool: `get_csv_features`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "source_files/Student Performance.csv"}`
- **Log:** The dataset has been successfully loaded, and it contains 33 columns. The user is interested in understanding the impact of being in a romantic relationship on students. The relevant column for this analysis is likely "romantic," which indicates whether a student is in a romantic relationship. To proceed, I need to identify other features that might be relevant for analyzing the impact of romantic relationships on students, such as academic performance or social activities.

I will now extract the features from the dataset to identify potential columns for analysis.

### Tool: `clean_missing_values`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "source_files/Student Performance.csv"}`
- **Log:** The dataset contains various features, including 'romantic', which indicates whether a student is in a romantic relationship. To analyze the impact of romantic relationships on students, we should consider features related to academic performance (such as 'G1', 'G2', 'G3' for grades) and social activities (such as 'goout', 'freetime', 'Dalc', 'Walc' for alcohol consumption). 

Now, I will formulate a plan to execute the task of analyzing the impact of being in a romantic relationship on students.

### Plan:
1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset and clean any missing values.
   - Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Focus on the 'romantic' feature and its correlation with academic performance ('G1', 'G2', 'G3') and social activities ('goout', 'freetime', 'Dalc', 'Walc').

3. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Use correlation analysis to determine the relationship between 'romantic' and academic performance features ('G1', 'G2', 'G3').
   - Use distribution analysis to understand the impact on social activities ('goout', 'freetime', 'Dalc', 'Walc').

4. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use bar charts or pie charts to visualize the distribution of students in romantic relationships.
   - Use correlation heatmaps to visualize the relationships between 'romantic' and other features.

5. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings, specifying the type of bias, relevant features, bias level, and additional explanations.

Next, I will proceed with the data preprocessing step by cleaning any missing values in the dataset.

Action Input: {
    "file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_student_performance.csv",
    "column_name": "freetime"
}
- **Result:** `{'Skewness': -0.16335075302040777}`

---

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_skewness`
- **Input:** `{
    "file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_student_performance.csv",
    "column_name": "Dalc"
}`
- **Log:** The skewness value for the 'freetime' feature is approximately -0.163, which indicates a Level 1 bias. This means the distribution of the 'freetime' feature is fairly symmetrical, showing no significant skewness.

Next, I will analyze the distribution of the 'Dalc' (weekday alcohol consumption) feature using skewness.

Action: numerical_distribution_skewness
Action Input: {
    "file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_student_performance.csv",
    "column_name": "Dalc"
}
- **Result:** `{'Skewness': 2.190761845462348}`

### Tool: `numerical_distribution_skewness`
- **Input:** `{
    "file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_student_performance.csv",
    "column_name": "Walc"
}`
- **Log:** The skewness value for the 'Dalc' (weekday alcohol consumption) feature is approximately 2.191, which indicates a Level 5 bias. This means the distribution of the 'Dalc' feature is highly skewed, showing a significant bias towards one side.

Finally, I will analyze the distribution of the 'Walc' (weekend alcohol consumption) feature using skewness.

Action: numerical_distribution_skewness
Action Input: {
    "file_path": "generated_files/cleaned_student_performance.csv",
    "column_name": "Walc"
}
- **Result:** `{'Skewness': 0.6119599829215362}`

}`
- **Log:** The skewness value for the 'Walc' (weekend alcohol consumption) feature is approximately 0.612, which indicates a Level 2 bias. This means the distribution of the 'Walc' feature is moderately skewed, showing a small bias.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Bias Type:** 
   - Correlation and Distribution

2. **Relevant Features:**
   - Correlation: 'romantic' with 'G1', 'G2', 'G3'
   - Distribution: 'goout', 'freetime', 'Dalc', 'Walc'

3. **Bias Level:**
   - Correlation between 'romantic' and 'G1': Level 1 (No significant bias)
   - Correlation between 'romantic' and 'G2': Level 1 (No significant bias)
   - Correlation between 'romantic' and 'G3': Level 2 (Small bias)
   - Distribution of 'goout': Level 1 (No significant skewness)
   - Distribution of 'freetime': Level 1 (No significant skewness)
   - Distribution of 'Dalc': Level 5 (Highly skewed)
   - Distribution of 'Walc': Level 2 (Moderately skewed)

4. **Additional Explanation:**
   - The analysis indicates that being in a romantic relationship does not significantly impact academic performance ('G1', 'G2', 'G3'), as the bias levels are low (Level 1 and Level 2).
   - The distribution of social activities such as 'goout' and 'freetime' is fairly symmetrical, indicating no significant bias.
   - However, the 'Dalc' feature shows a high level of skewness, indicating a significant bias in weekday alcohol consumption. The 'Walc' feature shows moderate skewness, indicating a small bias in weekend alcohol consumption.

5. **Overall Bias Level:**
   - Considering both correlation and distribution analyses, the overall bias level is Level 2, indicating a small bias primarily due to the skewness in alcohol consumption features.

I will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.
