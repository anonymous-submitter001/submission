## Final Analysis
**Conclusion:**

The analysis of the dataset regarding the correlation between "foreign worker" status and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)" has been completed. Here is a detailed summary of the findings:

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** Foreign Worker, Credit Risk (Good/Bad)
3. **Bias Level:**
   - **Cramér's V Analysis:** Level 1 (No Bias)
     - The Cramér's V value of 0.0763 indicates a very weak association between the "foreign worker" status and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)".
   - **Statistical Parity Analysis:** Level 2 (Minimal Bias)
     - The maximum Z-value of 0.4187 suggests minimal bias, with slight variations in the distribution of credit risk.

4. **Detailed Explanation:**
   - **Level 1 (No Bias):** Based on the Cramér's V analysis, the feature "foreign worker" shows no significant bias in relation to "Credit risk (Good/Bad)". The Cramér's V value of 0.0763 is very close to the ideal state, indicating that the dataset can be confidently used without concerns of bias from this perspective.
   - **Level 2 (Minimal Bias):** The statistical parity analysis indicates minimal bias with a maximum Z-value of 0.4187. While there are slight variations in the distribution of credit risk, the dataset remains suitable for use with minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.

5. **Additional Explanation:**
   The analysis reveals that the dataset does not exhibit significant bias concerning the correlation between foreign worker status and credit risk. The results from both Cramér's V and statistical parity analyses suggest that the dataset is reliable for further analysis, with only minor considerations needed for potential bias.

6. **Overall Bias Level:**
   Considering the results from both analyses, the overall bias level can be summarized as minimal, indicating that the dataset is generally suitable for use.

- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/foreign_workers_credit_history.csv"}`
- **Log:** The relevant columns "foreign worker" and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)" have been successfully extracted into a new dataset. Now, I need to formulate an overall plan for executing the task of detecting bias in this dataset.

### Overall Plan:
1. **Understanding and Preprocessing the Dataset:**
   - Load the extracted dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis.
   - Clean any missing values if present.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - Since both "foreign worker" and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)" are categorical variables, I will use categorical-categorical correlation methods to detect any bias.
   - Use the following tools from the available toolset:
     - `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v`: To measure the strength of association between the two categorical variables.
     - `categorical_categorical_correlation_statistical_parity`: To check for any disparity in the distribution of credit risk between foreign and non-foreign workers.
   - Additionally, I will review reference literature to find any other relevant methods with an ending digit greater than 5.

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use a bar chart to visualize the distribution of credit risk among foreign and non-foreign workers.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings based on the results from the tools used, categorizing the bias level into one of the five tiers.

Next, I will proceed with the detection and analysis methods by executing the selected tools.

### Tool: `generate_bias_report_pdf`
- **Input:** `{"tool_input": "generated_files/foreign_workers_credit_history.csv"}`
- **Log:** The maximum Z-value is 0.4187, which indicates a minimal bias according to the statistical parity analysis. This corresponds to Level 2, suggesting no notable bias but some slight variations in the distribution of credit risk between foreign and non-foreign workers.

### Summary of Findings:
1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** Foreign Worker, Credit Risk (Good/Bad)
3. **Bias Level:** 
   - **Cramér's V Analysis:** Level 1 (No Bias)
     - The Cramér's V value of 0.0763 indicates a very weak association between the "foreign worker" status and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)".
   - **Statistical Parity Analysis:** Level 2 (Minimal Bias)
     - The maximum Z-value of 0.4187 suggests minimal bias, with slight variations in the distribution of credit risk.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Level 1 (No Bias):** Based on the Cramér's V analysis, the feature "foreign worker" shows no significant bias in relation to "Credit risk (Good/Bad)". The Cramér's V value of 0.0763 is very close to the ideal state, indicating that the dataset can be confidently used without concerns of bias from this perspective.
- **Level 2 (Minimal Bias):** The statistical parity analysis indicates minimal bias with a maximum Z-value of 0.4187. While there are slight variations in the distribution of credit risk, the dataset remains suitable for use with minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.

### Additional Explanation:
The analysis reveals that the dataset does not exhibit significant bias concerning the correlation between foreign worker status and credit risk. The results from both Cramér's V and statistical parity analyses suggest that the dataset is reliable for further analysis, with only minor considerations needed for potential bias.

### Overall Bias Level:
Considering the results from both analyses, the overall bias level can be summarized as minimal, indicating that the dataset is generally suitable for use.
