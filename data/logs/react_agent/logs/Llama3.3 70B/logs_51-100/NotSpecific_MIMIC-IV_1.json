    "output": "The final answer is: The bias type is \"Distribution\", the relevant feature is \"patient_lang\", the bias level is 4, and the overall bias level is 4. The Shannon balance calculated for the language feature is 0.5139382417277789, which is relatively low, suggesting that the distribution of the language feature is skewed, with some categories dominating the others. This could potentially lead to biased treatment or outcomes. A bias level of 4 indicates a significant bias in the distribution of the language feature.
