The bias type is Correlation, and the relevant features are patient_race, admission_type, admission_location, and discharge_location. The additional explanation is that the bias level of 2 indicates a moderate level of bias, which may be due to various factors such as differences in treatment protocols, healthcare provider biases, or socioeconomic disparities.",
