    "output": "The final answer is that there is a moderate level of bias (Level 3) in the dataset, with students who are not in a romantic relationship tend to have higher average grades than those who are in a romantic relationship. The bias type is Distribution, and the relevant features are romantic, G1, G2, and G3. The additional explanation is that the results suggest that students who are not in a romantic relationship tend to have higher average grades than those who are in a romantic relationship, indicating a trend where being in a romantic relationship has a negative effect on student performance. The standard deviation of grades for students in a romantic relationship is slightly higher, indicating a slightly larger variation in their performance.",

The task is to find any general trends on how being in a romantic relationship might affect students, and the dataset is Student Performance.csv. I have analyzed the data and found that students who are not in a romantic relationship tend to have higher average grades than those who are in a romantic relationship. This could indicate a trend where being in a romantic relationship has a negative effect on student performance. The standard deviation of grades for students in a romantic relationship is slightly higher, indicating a slightly larger variation in their performance.\n\nAction: None\n",
