    "output": "The final answer is that the income distribution has a moderate level of balance, with a bias level of Level 3. The relevant feature is 'income', and the bias type is \"Distribution\". The Shannon balance value is 0.7963839552022132, indicating a moderate level of balance in the distribution. This suggests that the income distribution is not heavily skewed towards one group, but there is still some imbalance that may need to be addressed. The overall bias level is Level 3.",
