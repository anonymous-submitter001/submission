The bias level is \"Level 1\", which indicates a relatively even distribution of occupations in the dataset. The Shannon entropy value of 3.5169 indicates a moderate level of disorder in the occupation attribute, while the balance measure value of 1.0587 indicates a relatively even distribution of occupations. Overall, the results suggest that the distribution of occupations in the dataset is relatively even, with no significant bias towards any particular occupation.",
