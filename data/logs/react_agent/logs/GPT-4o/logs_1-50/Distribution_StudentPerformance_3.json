This level of bias is categorized as Level 2, indicating that the dataset is suitable for use with minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.

The skewness value of 0.632, calculated using the numerical distribution skewness method, suggests that the distribution is slightly skewed but not significantly so. This indicates that while there is some asymmetry in how study time is distributed among students, it is not severe enough to cause major concerns.\n- The skewness value falls within the range of 0.5 to 0.8, which corresponds to Level 2 bias. This means that the dataset is still suitable for use, with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios where distribution symmetry might be critical.\n\n**Additional Explanation**:\n- The skewness value provides insight into the shape of the distribution. A value closer to zero would indicate a more symmetrical distribution, while higher values suggest more pronounced skewness. In this case, the skewness of 0.632 indicates a slight right skew, meaning that there are more students with lower study times compared to those with higher study times.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"The analysis of the 'studytime' feature in the dataset 'Student Performance.csv' indicates a minimal level of bias.
