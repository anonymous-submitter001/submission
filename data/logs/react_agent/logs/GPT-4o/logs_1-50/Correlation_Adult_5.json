Now, I will summarize the findings and generate a detailed report.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type:** Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features:** \"race\" and \"occupation\"\n3. **Bias Level:** Based on the Cram√©r's V value of 0.0808, the bias level is categorized as Level 1, indicating no significant bias.\n4. **Detailed Explanation:**\n   - **Cram√©r's V Analysis:** The Cram√©r's V value of 0.0808 suggests a very weak association between \"race\" and \"occupation\". This indicates that there is no significant correlation or bias between these two features in the dataset.\n   - **Heatmap Visualization:** The heatmap provides a visual representation of the frequency distribution between \"race\" and \"occupation\", supporting the conclusion that there is no strong pattern or bias.\n\n### Feedback to User:\n\nBased on my analysis, it appears that the features \"race\" and \"occupation\" in this dataset show no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the Cram√©r's V value is 0.0808, which falls under Level 1, suggesting no significant bias. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.\n\n### Additional Explanation:\n\nThe analysis conducted using Cram√©r's V and the heatmap visualization confirms that there is no meaningful connection between \"race\" and \"occupation\" in the dataset. The weak association suggests that these features are independent, and there is no significant bias present.\n\nNow, I will generate the detection report.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"generated_files/cleaned_race_occupation_dataset.csv\"}",
