This confirms a relatively high level of randomness in the distribution, supporting the earlier findings from the Shannon Balance metric.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n1. **Bias Type:** Distribution\n2. **Relevant Feature(s):** Occupation\n3. **Bias Level:** Based on the analysis, the bias level can be categorized as Level 2 (Minimal Bias). Here's the detailed explanation:\n   - **Shannon Balance Metric:** The balance metric is approximately 0.90, which falls in the range of 0.80 to 0.95, indicating minimal bias. This suggests that the distribution of occupations is relatively even.\n   - **Max-Min Ratio:** The ratio of 460.0 indicates a significant difference between the most and least common occupations, suggesting some imbalance.\n   - **Entropy:** The entropy value of approximately 3.52, with a normalized entropy of 0.90, indicates a high level of randomness, supporting the notion of minimal bias.\n\n**Feedback to User:**\nBased on my analysis, the distribution of occupations in this dataset exhibits no notable bias. However, according to the results from multiple tools, there are some slight variations in certain metrics. For example, the Shannon Balance metric calculated a value of 0.90, the Max-Min Ratio returned 460.0, and the entropy measured 3.52. While the bias is minor, I believe the dataset is still suitable for use, with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\nThe analysis indicates that while there is a significant difference between the most and least common occupations, the overall distribution is relatively even, as evidenced by the high entropy and balance metrics. This suggests that the dataset can be used with confidence, though some attention may be needed in specific applications where occupation distribution is critical.\n\nNow, I will generate the detection report.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"generated_files/cleaned_occupation_data.csv\"}",
