This suggests that the distribution is heavily skewed, with certain durations being over-represented.\n   - **Kurtosis**: The kurtosis value of 0.92 suggests moderate tailedness, indicating that the distribution's tails are not significantly different from a normal distribution.\n   - **Outliers**: With 1.4% of the data points being outliers, the presence of extreme values is relatively low, suggesting that while there are some over-represented durations, they do not overwhelmingly affect the dataset.\n\n**Feedback to User**:\nBased on my analysis, the \"Duration in month\" feature in this dataset shows a very severe bias due to its high skewness. The results from the tools I used indicate that the distribution is heavily skewed, with a skewness value of 1.094. The kurtosis value of 0.92 suggests moderate tailedness, and the outlier percentage is 1.4%, indicating a relatively low presence of extreme values. This level of bias may significantly affect the dataset's reliability, and I strongly recommend thoroughly considering the implications of this bias. You may need to adjust the dataset to mitigate these effects.\n\n**Additional Explanation**:\nThe high skewness indicates that the distribution of employment duration is not balanced, with certain durations being over-represented. This could lead to biased insights if not addressed. The moderate kurtosis suggests that the distribution's tails are not extreme, but the presence of outliers, although low, should be considered in the analysis.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"generated_files/cleaned_duration_in_month.csv\"}",
