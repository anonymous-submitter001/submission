These values suggest a significant bias, confirming that certain education levels dominate the dataset.\n\nNow, I will summarize the findings and generate a detailed report.\n\n1. **Bias Type**: Distribution\n2. **Relevant Feature(s)**: Education\n3. **Bias Level**: Based on the results from the tools used, the bias level is categorized as Level 4 (Significant Bias). This is due to the moderate Shannon Balance, high Max-Min Ratio, and high Gini Index, all indicating significant imbalance in the distribution of education levels.\n\n**Feedback to User**:\n- Based on my analysis, the distribution of education levels in this dataset displays significant bias. The Shannon Balance metric is 0.7328, indicating moderate bias. The Max-Min Ratio is approximately 205.90, suggesting a significant imbalance, and the Gini Index values (Corrected: 0.8097, Adjusted: 0.8637) further confirm this significant bias. This level of bias could impact the accuracy of your analysis in certain contexts. I would advise a cautious assessment of the potential effects before using this dataset.\n\n**Additional Explanation**:\n- The Shannon Balance metric, Max-Min Ratio, and Gini Index collectively indicate that the distribution of education levels is not uniform, with certain levels being disproportionately represented. This could lead to skewed insights if not addressed, especially in analyses that assume a balanced representation of education levels.\n\nI will now generate the detection report.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"The analysis of the education levels in the dataset indicates significant bias.
