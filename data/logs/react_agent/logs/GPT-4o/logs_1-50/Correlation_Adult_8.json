    "output": "The analysis of the dataset \"Adult.csv\" focused on exploring the correlation between gender and income to identify any potential pay gap. The findings are as follows:\n\n1. **Bias Type:** Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features:** \"sex\" (gender) and \"income\"\n3. **Bias Level:** The bias level is categorized as Level 2 (Minimal Bias).\n\n- **Cramér's V Analysis:** The Cramér's V value of 0.2159 indicates a moderate association between \"sex\" and \"income\", suggesting minimal bias.\n- **Statistical Parity Analysis:** The maximum Z-value of 0.3072 also indicates minimal bias in the distribution of income across different genders.\n\n### Visualization:\n- A bar chart was created to visualize the distribution of income across different genders, saved as \"generated_files/income_distribution_bar_chart.png\".\n\n### Additional Explanation:\nThe analysis indicates a minimal bias in the correlation between gender and income. The Cramér's V value suggests a moderate association, while the Statistical Parity analysis confirms minimal bias. These results imply that while there is some association between gender and income, it is not substantial enough to indicate a significant pay gap.\n\nThe detailed detection report has been successfully generated and saved as \"generated_files/gender_income_bias_report.pdf\".
