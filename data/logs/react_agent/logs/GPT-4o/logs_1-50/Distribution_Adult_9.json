This suggests that there is a small concentration of values that deviate significantly from the rest of the data.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n1. **Bias Type:** Distribution\n2. **Relevant Feature(s):** hours-per-week\n3. **Bias Level:** Based on the analysis, the bias level can be categorized as Level 1 (No Bias) due to the following observations:\n   - **Skewness:** The skewness value of 0.23 indicates a slight positive skew, suggesting a minor asymmetry in the distribution.\n   - **Kurtosis:** The kurtosis value of 2.92 is close to the normal distribution value, indicating no significant peaks or flatness.\n   - **Outliers:** Only 1.35% of the data points are outliers, suggesting minimal concentration in certain ranges.\n\n**Feedback to User:**\n\nBased on my analysis, it appears that the \"hours-per-week\" feature in this dataset shows no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the skewness value is 0.23, the kurtosis is 2.92, and the outlier percentage is 1.35%. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\n\nThe distribution of weekly work hours is slightly skewed to the right, but this skewness is not significant enough to indicate bias. The kurtosis value suggests that the distribution is similar to a normal distribution, and the low percentage of outliers indicates minimal concentration in specific ranges. Overall, the dataset's distribution of weekly work hours is balanced and suitable for analysis.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI will generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"The analysis of the 'hours-per-week' feature in the dataset indicates a balanced distribution with no significant bias.
