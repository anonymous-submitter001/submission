The results from the tools I used indicate that the distribution is highly imbalanced. For instance, the Shannon Balance returned a value of 0.174, the Max-Min Ratio showed 29170.0, and the Relative Risk analysis highlighted a significant disparity with a Normalized Bias Score of 29170.0. These values indicate extreme bias, which may significantly affect the dataset’s reliability. I strongly recommend thoroughly considering the implications of this bias, and you may need to adjust the dataset to mitigate these effects.\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\n\nThe \"native-country\" feature is dominated by entries from the United States, leading to a lack of diversity and representation from other countries. This extreme bias could impact any analysis or modeling that relies on geographic representation, potentially skewing results and insights.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI will generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"generated_files/native_country_dataset.csv\"}",
