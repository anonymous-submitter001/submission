The results from the tool I used, which calculated a Cramér's V value of 0.0956, indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.\n\n### Additional Explanation:\n\nThe Cramér's V value is a measure of association between two categorical variables. A value close to 0 indicates little to no association, while a value closer to 1 indicates a strong association. In this case, the value of 0.0956 suggests that education levels and gender are not significantly correlated, implying that there is no notable bias in the dataset regarding these features.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"generated_files/cleaned_education_sex_dataset.csv\"}",
