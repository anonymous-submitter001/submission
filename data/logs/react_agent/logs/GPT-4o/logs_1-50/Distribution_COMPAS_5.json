For example, the Shannon Balance returned a value of 0.0387, the Max-Min Ratio was 240.44, and the Entropy was 0.0387. These values indicate extreme bias, which may significantly affect the dataset’s reliability. I strongly recommend thoroughly considering the implications of this bias, and you may need to adjust the dataset to mitigate these effects.\n\n### Additional Explanation\nThe analysis reveals that the language distribution among defendants is highly skewed, with one language being overwhelmingly predominant. This extreme bias could impact any analysis or decisions based on this dataset, as it does not accurately represent a diverse linguistic population.\n\n### Overall Bias Level\nThe overall bias level for the language distribution in this dataset is Level 5 (Extreme Bias), indicating a need for careful consideration and potential adjustment of the dataset.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"generated_files/cleaned_language_distribution.csv\"}\n\nFinal Answer: The analysis of the language distribution among defendants in the COMPAS dataset reveals an extreme bias, with one language being overwhelmingly predominant.
