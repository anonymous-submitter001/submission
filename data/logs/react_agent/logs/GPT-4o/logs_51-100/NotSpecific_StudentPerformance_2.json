    "output": "The analysis of the dataset regarding the impact of being in a romantic relationship on students reveals the following:\n\n1. **Bias Type:** The analysis involves both correlation and distribution biases.\n\n2. **Relevant Features:** The features analyzed include 'romantic', 'G1', 'G2', 'G3' (academic performance), and 'goout', 'freetime', 'Dalc', 'Walc' (social activities).\n\n3. **Bias Level:**\n   - Correlation between 'romantic' and 'G1': Level 1 (No significant bias)\n   - Correlation between 'romantic' and 'G2': Level 1 (No significant bias)\n   - Correlation between 'romantic' and 'G3': Level 2 (Small bias)\n   - Distribution of 'goout': Level 1 (No significant skewness)\n   - Distribution of 'freetime': Level 1 (No significant skewness)\n   - Distribution of 'Dalc': Level 5 (Highly skewed)\n   - Distribution of 'Walc': Level 2 (Moderately skewed)\n\n4. **Additional Explanation:** The analysis indicates that being in a romantic relationship does not significantly impact academic performance ('G1', 'G2', 'G3'), as the bias levels are low (Level 1 and Level 2). The distribution of social activities such as 'goout' and 'freetime' is fairly symmetrical, indicating no significant bias. However, the 'Dalc' feature shows a high level of skewness, indicating a significant bias in weekday alcohol consumption. The 'Walc' feature shows moderate skewness, indicating a small bias in weekend alcohol consumption.\n\n5. **Overall Bias Level:** Considering both correlation and distribution analyses, the overall bias level is Level 2, indicating a small bias primarily due to the skewness in alcohol consumption features.\n\nThe detailed bias detection report has been successfully created and saved as a PDF.
