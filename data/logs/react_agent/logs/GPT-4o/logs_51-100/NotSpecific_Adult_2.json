    "output": "The analysis of the dataset \"source_files/Adult.csv\" focused on detecting unintended biases related to educational attainment. The correlation analysis using Cramér's V between 'education' and 'income' revealed a moderate level of association with a Cramér's V value of 0.369. This suggests that educational attainment has a moderate impact on income levels, indicating a potential bias in income opportunities based on education. The overall bias level is categorized as Level 3, indicating a moderate bias. Further analysis considering other demographic factors is recommended to fully understand the implications of this bias.
