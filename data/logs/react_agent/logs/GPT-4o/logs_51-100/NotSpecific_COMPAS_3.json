This indicates that the age data is consistent and does not contain extreme values that could skew the analysis.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n1. **Bias Type:** Distribution\n2. **Relevant Feature(s):** Age\n3. **Bias Level:**\n   - **Skewness:** Level 3 (Moderate negative skew)\n   - **Kurtosis:** No significant bias (Platykurtic distribution)\n   - **Outliers:** Level 1 (No outliers)\n4. **Overall Bias Level:** Level 2 (Considering the moderate skewness and absence of outliers, the overall bias level is low to moderate.)\n\n### Explanation:\n- The age distribution shows a moderate negative skew, indicating that there are more younger individuals compared to older ones, with a longer tail on the left side. This results in a Level 3 bias for skewness.\n- The kurtosis analysis reveals a platykurtic distribution, which is more spread out and less peaked than a normal distribution. This does not indicate significant bias.\n- The absence of outliers in the age data suggests that the distribution is consistent and reliable, contributing to a Level 1 bias for outliers.\n\nOverall, the age distribution in the dataset exhibits a low to moderate level of bias, primarily due to the moderate negative skewness. This suggests that while there is some asymmetry in the age distribution, it is not severe enough to cause major concerns.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"The age distribution in the dataset exhibits a low to moderate level of bias, primarily due to the moderate negative skewness.
