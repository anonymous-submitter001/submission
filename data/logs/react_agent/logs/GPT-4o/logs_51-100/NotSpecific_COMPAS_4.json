There is a low correlation between 'Language' and 'Ethnic_Code_Text' (Level 2), suggesting some relationship between language and ethnicity. A high correlation exists between 'Language' and 'RecSupervisionLevel' (Level 4), indicating language significantly impacts the recommended supervision level. No significant correlation is found between 'Language' and 'ScoreText' (Level 1). Overall, the bias level is categorized as Level 4 due to the extreme distribution bias and high correlation with supervision level.
