According to the bias evaluation criteria for Cramér's V:\n\n- Cramér's V < 0.1: Level 1 (No bias)\n- 0.1 <= Cramér's V < 0.3: Level 2 (Low bias)\n- 0.3 <= Cramér's V < 0.5: Level 3 (Moderate bias)\n- 0.5 <= Cramér's V < 0.7: Level 4 (High bias)\n- Cramér's V >= 0.7: Level 5 (Extreme bias)\n\nThe result indicates a Level 2 bias, suggesting a low correlation between 'patient_insurance' and 'discharge_location'. This implies that the type of insurance has a low impact on the discharge location.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n1. **Bias Type:** Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features:** 'patient_insurance', 'admission_type', 'admission_location', 'discharge_location'\n3. **Bias Levels:**\n   - 'patient_insurance' and 'admission_type': Level 2 (Low bias)\n   - 'patient_insurance' and 'admission_location': Level 2 (Low bias)\n   - 'patient_insurance' and 'discharge_location': Level 2 (Low bias)\n4. **Overall Bias Level:** Level 2 (Low bias)\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe analysis indicates a low level of bias in the correlation between the type of insurance and access to medical services, as measured by admission type, admission location, and discharge location. This suggests that while there is some correlation, it is not strong enough to indicate significant unequal access based on insurance type.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"The analysis of the dataset 'MIMIC-IV_cleaned.csv' reveals a low level of correlation between 'patient_insurance' and features related to access to medical services.
