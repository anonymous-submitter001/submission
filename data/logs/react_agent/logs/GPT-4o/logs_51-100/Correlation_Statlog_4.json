    "output": "The analysis of the dataset regarding the correlation between \"foreign worker\" status and \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\" has been completed. Here is a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type:** Correlation\n   - **Relevant Features:** \"foreign worker\" and \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\"\n\n2. **Detection and Analysis:**\n   - **Cramér's V Analysis:**\n     - The Cramér's V value is 0.0763, indicating a very weak association between the \"foreign worker\" status and \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\".\n     - This result falls into Level 1, suggesting no significant bias.\n   - **Statistical Parity Analysis:**\n     - The Max Z-value is 0.4187, indicating a minimal bias in the distribution of credit risk between foreign workers and non-foreign workers.\n     - This result falls into Level 2, suggesting minimal bias.\n\n3. **Visualization:**\n   - A bar chart can be used to visualize the distribution of credit risk among foreign workers and non-foreign workers, providing a clear visual representation of the data.\n\n4. **Bias Level Explanation:**\n   - **Level 1 (No Bias):** Based on the Cramér's V analysis, the feature(s) in this dataset show no significant bias. The Cramér's V value of 0.0763 is very close to the ideal state, indicating that the \"foreign worker\" status does not significantly affect credit risk.\n   - **Level 2 (Minimal Bias):** The Statistical Parity analysis suggests a minimal bias with a Max Z-value of 0.4187. While there is some slight variation, the dataset is still suitable for use with minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.\n\n5. **Additional Explanation:**\n   - The analysis indicates that the \"foreign worker\" status does not significantly impact credit risk, with only minimal bias observed. This suggests that the dataset can be used confidently, with minor considerations for the minimal bias detected.\n\nThe detailed bias detection report has been successfully created and saved as a PDF. You can access it here: [bias_detection_report.pdf](generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf).\n\nIf you have any additional needs or other tasks to be done, please let me know!",

The Cramér's V value of 0.0763 is very close to the ideal state, indicating that the \"foreign worker\" status does not significantly affect credit risk.\n   - **Level 2 (Minimal Bias):** The Statistical Parity analysis suggests a minimal bias with a Max Z-value of 0.4187. While there is some slight variation, the dataset is still suitable for use with minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.\n\n5. **Additional Explanation:**\n   - The analysis indicates that the \"foreign worker\" status does not significantly impact credit risk, with only minimal bias observed. This suggests that the dataset can be used confidently, with minor considerations for the minimal bias detected.\n\n**Overall Bias Level:** Based on the results from both Cramér's V and Statistical Parity analyses, the overall bias level is minimal.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"generated_files/cleaned_foreign_worker_credit_risk.csv\"}",
