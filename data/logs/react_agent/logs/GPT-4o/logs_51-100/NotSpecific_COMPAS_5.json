    "output": "The analysis of the COMPAS dataset focused on detecting any hidden influence of marital status on assessment outcomes. The relevant features analyzed were \"MaritalStatus,\" \"ScoreText,\" and \"DecileScore.\" The correlation analysis revealed a low bias (Level 2) between \"MaritalStatus\" and \"ScoreText,\" and a moderate bias (Level 3) between \"MaritalStatus\" and \"DecileScore.\" Overall, the influence of marital status on the dataset is categorized as a moderate bias (Level 3). This suggests that while marital status has a minor impact on score text, it has a more significant effect on decile scores, which could influence assessment decisions.
