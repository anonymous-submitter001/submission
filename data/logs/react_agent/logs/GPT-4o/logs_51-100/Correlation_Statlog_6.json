Using the Chi-Square test, we found a Chi-Square statistic of 12.617 with a p-value of 0.397, indicating no significant correlation bias. This suggests that the distribution of credit history is balanced across different job types, showing no significant bias. You can confidently use this dataset for further analyses.

This indicates a low level of bias.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n- **Level 1 (No Bias):** Based on my analysis, it appears that the features \"Credit history\" and \"Job\" in this dataset show no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the Chi-Square test indicate that the p-value is 0.397, which is much higher than the typical threshold of 0.05. This suggests that any observed differences in the distribution of credit history across job types are likely due to random chance rather than a systematic bias. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.\n\n### Additional Explanation:\n\nThe Chi-Square test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. In this case, the test was applied to \"Credit history\" and \"Job\" to check for correlation bias. The high p-value suggests that there is no significant association, indicating that the distribution of credit history is fairly balanced across different job types.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nI will generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"The analysis of the dataset 'Statlog.csv' focused on detecting correlation bias between the features 'Credit history' and 'Job'.
