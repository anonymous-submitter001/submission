This indicates that the \"Personal status and sex\" feature does not significantly impact the credit risk outcomes in the dataset.\n- **Statistical Parity Analysis:** The Max Z-value of 0.218 further supports the finding that there is no significant difference in credit risk outcomes across different groups defined by \"Personal status and sex\".\n\nBased on my analysis, it appears that the feature \"Personal status and sex\" in this dataset shows no significant bias in relation to credit risk outcomes. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, Cramér's V returned a value of 0.098, and Statistical Parity showed a Max Z-value of 0.218.
