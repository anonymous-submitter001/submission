The Cohen's d effect sizes for the correlations between the 'higher' feature and the academic performance features ('G1', 'G2', 'G3') are all above 0.8, indicating a Level 4 bias. This suggests that students with higher grades are significantly more likely to plan for higher education. The overall bias level is categorized as Level 4, reflecting a strong correlation pattern in the dataset.\"}\n\nFinal Answer: The analysis of the 'Student Performance' dataset indicates a strong correlation between students' plans for higher education and their academic performance, with a consistent Level 4 bias across the grading periods. This suggests that students with higher grades are significantly more likely to plan for higher education. A detailed detection report has been generated to summarize these findings.",
