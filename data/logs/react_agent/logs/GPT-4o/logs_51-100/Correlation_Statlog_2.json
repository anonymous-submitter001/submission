    "output": "The analysis of the dataset \"Statlog.csv\" focused on examining the correlation between \"Age in years\" and \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\". The findings indicate no significant bias, with a Cohen's d effect size of approximately 0.20 and a standardized difference of -0.23. These results suggest that the age distribution does not significantly differ between the two credit risk categories, indicating that the dataset is suitable for use without concerns of bias affecting the analysis. A bar chart was also created to visualize the distribution of credit risk across different age groups. The overall bias level is Level 1, indicating no significant bias. The detailed detection report has been successfully generated and saved as a PDF at: generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf.
