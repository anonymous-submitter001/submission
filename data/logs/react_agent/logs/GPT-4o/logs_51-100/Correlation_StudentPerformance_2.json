The results from the tools I used indicate slight variations in certain metrics. For instance, Cohen's d returned a value of 0.145, and the standardized difference was 0.025. While the bias is minor, the dataset is still suitable for use, with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.\n\n### Additional Explanation:\n\nThe analysis shows that the school attended has a minimal impact on the final grade, as evidenced by the small effect size and standardized difference. This suggests that other factors may play a more significant role in determining student performance.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"generated_files/cleaned_school_final_grade.csv\"}",
