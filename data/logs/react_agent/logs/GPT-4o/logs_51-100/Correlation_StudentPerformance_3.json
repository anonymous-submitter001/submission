    "output": "The analysis of the dataset regarding the correlation between family support (\"famsup\") and academic performance (\"G3\") has been completed. Here's a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type**: Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features**: \"famsup\" (Family Support) and \"G3\" (Final Grade)\n3. **Bias Level**: \n   - Based on the Cohen's d effect size of 0.0801, the bias level is categorized as Level 1 (No Bias). This indicates that there is no significant bias in the relationship between family support and final grades.\n4. **Findings**:\n   - The Cohen's d effect size of 0.0801 suggests a very small effect size, indicating minimal bias in the relationship between family support and academic performance.\n   - The bar chart visualization of \"G3\" based on \"famsup\" categories provides a visual representation of the distribution, supporting the conclusion of minimal bias.\n\n5. **Additional Explanation**:\n   - The analysis shows that family support does not have a significant impact on the final grades of students in this dataset. The effect size is very close to zero, suggesting that other factors might play a more substantial role in determining academic performance.\n\nBased on my analysis, it appears that the feature(s) in this dataset show no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the Cohen's d effect size returned a value of 0.0801. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.\n\nThe detailed detection report has been successfully created and saved as a PDF. You can download it from [here](sandbox:/mnt/data/generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf). If you have any additional needs or other tasks to be done, please let me know!",

To proceed with the analysis, I need to identify the relevant features related to family support and academic performance. Based on the dataset, \"famsup\" (family support) and \"G3\" (final grade) seem to be the relevant features for this analysis. \n\nNext, I will formulate a plan to analyze the correlation between these two features.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing:**\n   - Extract the relevant columns: \"famsup\" and \"G3\".\n   - Clean any missing values if present.\n\n2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**\n   - Since \"famsup\" is a categorical variable and \"G3\" is a numerical variable, I will use the `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d` tool to measure the effect size and correlation between these two features.\n\n3. **Visualization:**\n   - Use a bar chart to visualize the distribution of \"G3\" based on the categories of \"famsup\".\n\n4. **Result Summarization:**\n   - Summarize the findings based on the correlation analysis and visualization.\n\nNow, I will proceed with extracting the relevant columns and cleaning the data. \n\nAction: extract_two_columns\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"source_files/Student Performance.csv\", \"columns\": [\"famsup\", \"G3\"]}",
