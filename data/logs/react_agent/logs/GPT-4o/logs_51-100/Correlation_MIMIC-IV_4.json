However, according to the Cramér's V result, there is a slight association between the two features. The Cramér's V value of 0.215 suggests a minimal level of correlation, which indicates that while there is some association, it is not strong enough to be considered significant. This means that the dataset is still suitable for use, with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.\n\n**Additional Explanation**:\n- The Cramér's V value is a measure of association between two categorical variables, with values closer to 0 indicating little to no association and values closer to 1 indicating a strong association. In this case, the value of 0.215 suggests a minimal level of association, which is not strong enough to indicate a significant bias.\n\nFinally, I will generate a detection report to document these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"generated_files/modified_race_mortality_dataset.csv\"}",
