The maximum absolute mean and standardized difference both suggest that while there is some correlation, it is not strong enough to indicate a significant bias.\n   - The \"Cohen's D\" method was not applicable due to the categorical feature having more than two categories, which is a requirement for this method.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"The analysis of the relationship between the reason for school choice and mother's education level indicates a low level of correlation bias.
