    "output": "The analysis of the dataset \"COMPAS.csv\" regarding the influence of the language spoken by defendants on assessment scores has been completed. Here's a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type**: Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features**: Language (categorical), RawScore (numerical)\n3. **Bias Level**: Based on the Cohen's d effect size of approximately 0.064, the bias level is categorized as Level 1 (No Bias).\n\n**Findings**:\n- **Level 1 (No Bias)**: Based on my analysis, it appears that the language spoken by defendants in this dataset shows no significant bias in influencing the assessment scores. The Cohen's d effect size of 0.064 is well below the threshold for minimal bias, indicating that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset without concerns about language bias affecting the assessment scores.\n\n**Visualization**:\n- A bar chart was created to visualize the distribution of assessment scores across different language groups. This visual representation supports the finding that there is no significant difference in scores based on language.\n\n**Additional Explanation**:\n- The Cohen's d effect size is a measure of the effect size between a categorical and a numerical variable. In this case, the effect size of 0.064 suggests that the language spoken by defendants does not have a meaningful impact on their assessment scores. This aligns with the visual analysis, which shows a balanced distribution of scores across language groups.\n\nThe detailed detection report has been successfully created and saved as a PDF. You can access it here: [COMPAS_language_bias_report.pdf](generated_files/COMPAS_language_bias_report.pdf).\n\nIf you have any additional needs or other tasks to be done, please let me know!",
