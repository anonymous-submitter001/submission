### Message Content:

COMPLETE TASK.

The bias type is Correlation.
The relevant features are education and sex.
The bias level is Level 5.
The results from the tools used indicate that the correlation between education and sex is statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.0. This suggests that there is a strong correlation between these two features.

Additional explanation: The correlation between education and sex may be due to various factors such as societal norms, discrimination, or differences in access to education. Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying causes of this correlation.

The overall bias level is Level 5, indicating a strong correlation between education and sex.

Here is a detailed summary of the conclusions based on the results obtained from each method:
* The Chi-square test indicates a significant correlation between education and sex, with a p-value of 0.0.
* The correlation coefficient is 0.23, indicating a moderate positive correlation between education and sex.

Recommendations for the user:
* The user should be aware of the potential correlation between education and sex when using this dataset for analysis or modeling.
* The user may want to consider controlling for sex when analyzing the relationship between education and other variables.
* The user may also want to explore the underlying causes of the correlation between education and sex, such as societal norms or discrimination.
