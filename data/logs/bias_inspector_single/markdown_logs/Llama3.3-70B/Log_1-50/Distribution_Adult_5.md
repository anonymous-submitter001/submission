Based on the results from the tools used, the feature "occupation" in the dataset shows extreme bias, with a max/min ratio of 460.0 and a Shannon entropy of 2.437731443352055. The feature "race" in the dataset shows potential bias, with a Shannon entropy of 0.5536448302489407. The feature "native-country" in the dataset shows potential bias, with a Shannon entropy of 0.6541891301020706.

The overall bias level of the dataset is Level 5 (Extreme Bias), based on the results from the max/min ratio method and the Shannon entropy method.

The report has been generated and saved as a PDF file at "generated_files/bias_report.pdf". The report includes the results from the tools used, as well as visualizations of the bias in the features.

It is recommended that the user carefully consider the implications of this bias and take steps to mitigate its effects, such as data preprocessing or feature engineering, before using the dataset for further analysis or modeling.
