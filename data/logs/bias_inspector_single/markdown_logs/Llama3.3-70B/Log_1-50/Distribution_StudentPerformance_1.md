### Message Content:

DECISION ANALYSIS.
Based on the results from the Chi-square test and Shannon entropy analysis, there is no significant correlation bias between the 'address' and 'sex' features in the Student Performance dataset. The p-value from the Chi-square test is 0.656, which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of independence. Additionally, the Shannon entropy calculated for the 'address' feature is 0.530, which is less than the maximum entropy of 0.693, suggesting some level of bias in the distribution of the 'address' feature. However, the bias is not extreme.
To further analyze the distribution of the 'address' feature, a bar chart has been generated and saved at generated_files/address_bar_chart.png.
Next, I will generate a detection report based on the analysis results.

COMPLETE TASK.
The overall bias level is Level 2 (Minimal Bias).
Based on the analysis results, the distribution of the 'address' feature shows some level of bias, but it is not extreme. The p-value from the Chi-square test is 0.656, which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of independence. Additionally, the Shannon entropy calculated for the 'address' feature is 0.530, which is less than the maximum entropy of 0.693, suggesting some level of bias in the distribution of the 'address' feature.
