### Message Content:

COMPLETE TASK.

The overall bias level of the marital status distribution in the Adult.csv dataset is Level 3 (Moderate Bias). 

The results from the Chi-Square test indicate that there is a significant deviation from the expected distribution, with a Chi-Square value of 220.45. This suggests that the marital status distribution is not uniform and may be biased towards certain categories.

The bar chart of the marital status distribution shows that the majority of the samples are married, while the minority are divorced or separated. This imbalance in the distribution may indicate a moderate level of bias.

Therefore, I recommend considering this bias in certain applications, such as data analysis or machine learning model training, to ensure that the results are fair and unbiased.

Additionally, I suggest further investigation into the causes of this bias and potential methods to mitigate it, such as data preprocessing or feature engineering techniques.

The PDF report generated provides more detailed information about the analysis, including the results of the Chi-Square test and the bar chart of the marital status distribution.
