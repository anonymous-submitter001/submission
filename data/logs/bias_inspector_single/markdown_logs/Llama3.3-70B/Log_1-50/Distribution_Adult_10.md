### Message Content:

DECISION ANALYSIS.

Based on the user's input, the task is to detect whether there is a notable pattern in the native country distribution in the Adult.csv dataset. 

The overall plan for executing this task includes the following steps:

1. Load the Adult.csv dataset and extract the 'native-country' feature.
2. Use the get_csv_features tool to get the feature names in the dataset.
3. Use the get_reference_method_by_id tool to get the method for detecting distribution bias in a categorical feature using the Chi-Square test.
4. Generate executable code based on this method and call the execute_python_code function to execute it.
5. Use the generate_bias_report_pdf tool to generate a PDF report based on the results.

The tools used in this task include:

* get_csv_features
* get_reference_method_by_id
* execute_python_code
* generate_bias_report_pdf

The values obtained and the extent of the bias will be included in the PDF report.

The PDF report will include the following sections:

* Introduction
* Methodology
* Results
* Discussion
* Conclusion

The report will provide a detailed analysis of the native country distribution in the Adult.csv dataset and will include visualizations to support the findings.

The user will be able to use the report to understand the distribution of the native country feature in the dataset and to identify any potential biases.

In terms of the bias level, the report will provide a categorization of the bias into one of the following five tiers:

* Level 1: No bias
* Level 2: Minimal bias
* Level 3: Moderate bias
* Level 4: Significant bias
* Level 5: Extreme bias

The report will also include a detailed explanation of the findings and will provide recommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset.

Overall, the report will provide a comprehensive analysis of the native country distribution in the Adult.csv dataset and will include detailed findings and recommendations for the user.
