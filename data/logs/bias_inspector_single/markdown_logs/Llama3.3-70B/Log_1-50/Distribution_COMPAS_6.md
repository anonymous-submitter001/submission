COMPLETE TASK.

Based on the results from the tools used, the feature ScaleSet_ID has extreme bias. Additionally, there are correlation biases between multiple pairs of categorical features.

The bias level is categorized into one of the five tiers based on the appropriate evaluation metric. The division of tiers should comprehensively take into account the evaluation metric recommendations from the various tools used.

The overall bias level is Level 5 (Extreme Bias), as indicated by the results from the tools used.

The findings are as follows:

* The feature ScaleSet_ID has extreme bias, with a max/min ratio of 100 or more.
* There are correlation biases between multiple pairs of categorical features, with p-values less than 0.05.

The results from the tools used indicate that the relevant metrics are very far from the ideal state. For instance, the max/min ratio for the feature ScaleSet_ID is 100 or more, and the p-values for the correlation biases between multiple pairs of categorical features are less than 0.05.

I believe you should thoroughly consider the implications of this bias and adjust the dataset to mitigate these effects.

Additional explanations of the bias extent and related findings are provided in the generated detection report.

The dataset analyzed is the COMPAS dataset, and the features examined are the categorical features in the dataset. The types of bias detected are distribution bias and correlation bias. The tools used are the max/min ratio tool and the Chi-square test tool. The values obtained and the extent of the bias are provided in the generated detection report.

Visualizations are provided in the generated detection report to support the analysis and conclusions.

My natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that the feature ScaleSet_ID has extreme bias, and there are correlation biases between multiple pairs of categorical features.

I recommend that you thoroughly consider the implications of this bias and adjust the dataset to mitigate these effects.

The generated detection report is provided in the file "generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf".

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need any additional assistance.
