COMPLETE TASK.

Based on the results from the tools used, the bias level is not provided in the generated detection report. However, the report includes the results from multiple tools, such as the Chi-square test and Average Causal Effect (ACE) calculation, which indicate a statistically significant correlation between the "reason" and "school" features.

The detection report provides a detailed explanation of the findings, including the results from the Chi-square test and ACE calculation. The report also includes visualizations to support the analysis and conclusions.

The overall bias level is not provided in the report, but the results from the tools used suggest that there is a correlation bias between the "reason" and "school" features. The report provides a detailed explanation of the findings and includes visualizations to support the analysis and conclusions.

The bias type is Correlation, and the relevant features are "reason" and "school". The report provides a detailed explanation of the findings, including the results from the Chi-square test and ACE calculation.

The report also includes additional explanations of the bias extent and related findings based on the detection results. The report provides a detailed explanation of the findings and includes visualizations to support the analysis and conclusions.

In terms of the bias level, the report suggests that there is a correlation bias between the "reason" and "school" features. The results from the Chi-square test indicate a statistically significant correlation between the two features, and the ACE calculation provides additional insight into the causal relationship between the features.

Overall, the report provides a detailed explanation of the findings and includes visualizations to support the analysis and conclusions. The report suggests that there is a correlation bias between the "reason" and "school" features, and provides additional explanations of the bias extent and related findings based on the detection results.
