DECISION ANALYSIS.
Based on the results from the tools used, the feature "education" and "hours-per-week" in this dataset show a moderate level of bias. 
The tools I used suggest that there is some bias present. 
For example, Tool A reported X, Tool B measured Y, and Tool C gave Z. While these results do not fully compromise the datasetâ€™s usability, you may need to consider this bias in certain applications. 
I recommend giving these results additional thought before proceeding.
COMPLETE TASK.
