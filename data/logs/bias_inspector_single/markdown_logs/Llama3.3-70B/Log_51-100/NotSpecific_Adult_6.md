### Message Content:

COMPLETE TASK.

Based on the results, the bias level is Level 4, indicating a significant correlation between native-country and income. The Average Causal Effect (ACE) of native-country on income is 0.23, and the mean squared error of the linear regression model is 0.15. These values suggest that there is a strong correlation between native-country and income, which may lead to biased outcomes.

The detection report provides a detailed analysis of the bias, including the features examined, the tools used, and the values obtained. The report also includes recommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset, such as being cautious when using the dataset for decision-making and considering techniques to reduce the bias.

Overall, the results suggest that the dataset contains significant correlation bias, and users should be aware of this when using the dataset for decision-making or analysis.
