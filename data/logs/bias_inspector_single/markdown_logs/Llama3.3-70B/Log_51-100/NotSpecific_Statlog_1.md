DECISION ANALYSIS.
Based on the results from the tools, I will now provide a detailed summary of the conclusions.
The max/min ratio for the "Credit amount" feature is 445.0, which indicates extreme bias.
The balance metric for the "Personal status and sex" feature is 0.7660518140593616, and the Shannon entropy is 1.5321036281187232.
These results suggest that there is a significant correlation bias between the "Credit amount" feature and the "Personal status and sex" feature.
The bias level for the "Credit amount" feature is Extreme Bias, and the bias level for the "Personal status and sex" feature is Moderate Bias.
Therefore, the overall bias level is Extreme Bias.
I will now generate a detection report using the generate_bias_report_pdf tool.
Please wait for a moment.
