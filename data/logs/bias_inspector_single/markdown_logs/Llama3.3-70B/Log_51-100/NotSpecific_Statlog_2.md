### Message Content:

COMPLETE TASK.

Based on the results from the tools used, the overall bias level is unknown due to the lack of the pgmpy library for calculating the causal effect. However, the correlation between 'Housing' and 'Credit history' is significant, indicating that the distribution of 'Credit history' varies across different 'Housing' categories. The causal analysis suggests that 'Housing' may have a direct impact on 'Credit amount'. 

The relevant features are 'Housing' and 'Credit history' for the correlation analysis, and 'Housing' and 'Credit amount' for the causal analysis. The bias type is correlation bias for the Chi-square test and potential causal bias for the Bayesian network analysis.

Additional explanation: The correlation between 'Housing' and 'Credit history' is significant, indicating that the distribution of 'Credit history' varies across different 'Housing' categories. The causal analysis suggests that 'Housing' may have a direct impact on 'Credit amount', but the exact causal effect cannot be determined due to the lack of the pgmpy library.
