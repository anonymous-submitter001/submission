### Message Content:

COMPLETE TASK.

Based on the results from the tools used, the bias level is moderate. The t-statistic is -3.45, the p-value is 0.0006, and the effect size (Cohen's d) is 0.65. These values indicate that there is a moderate level of bias between the paid and G3 features.

The box plot shows that the distribution of G3 scores is slightly different between the paid and not paid groups, with the paid group having a slightly higher median score.

The natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that there is a moderate level of bias between paid and G3. This means that the dataset may not be entirely reliable for analysis or modeling, and the user should consider the bias when using the dataset.

The recommendations for the user are to consider the bias when using the dataset for analysis or modeling, and to potentially use techniques to mitigate the bias, such as data preprocessing or feature engineering.
