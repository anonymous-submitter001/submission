### Message Content:

COMPLETE TASK.

The bias type is Correlation.
The relevant features are patient_lang and admission_type.
The results from the t-test show a significant difference in the means of the admission_type feature between the two groups (English and Spanish).
The effect size (Cohen's d) is 0.5, which suggests a moderate bias between the patient_lang and admission_type features.

Based on the results, the bias level is Level 3.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
