### Message Content:

Hello! I specialize in detecting and analyzing bias in structured datasets. Here's what I can help you with:

1. **Bias Detection**: Identify potential biases in your dataset, whether they relate to correlation between features or distribution within a single feature.
   
2. **Analysis**: Provide detailed analysis of the detected biases, including their severity and implications.

3. **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the detected biases to help you understand them better.

4. **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports summarizing the findings, complete with recommendations.

If you have a specific task in mind, like analyzing a particular dataset for bias, feel free to let me know!

### Message Content:

Great! Let's explore whether students from urban and rural areas are evenly represented and detect any dominant patterns in their place of residence.

### Task Definition:
**Detection Task:** Analyze the distribution of students based on their place of residence (urban or rural) to determine if there is any bias or dominant pattern.
**Dataset Path:** `source_files/Student Performance.csv`

Next, I'll formulate a plan to execute this task by exploring both toolset methods and reference literature.

### Plan for Detecting Distribution Bias in Student Residence:

**Dataset:** `source_files/Student Performance.csv`
**Relevant Feature:** `address` (categorical, representing urban or rural residence)

**Detection Type:** Distribution Bias

**Methods:**
1. **Toolset Methods:**
   - **Max/Min Ratio Method:** Evaluate the distribution bias using the max/min ratio of categories. This method is available in the toolset under `categorical_distribution_max_min_ratio`.
   
2. **Reference Literature Methods:**
   - **Reference A-0-8:** Using Jensen-Shannon Divergence to detect distribution bias in a categorical feature. This method is suitable for our context as it measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected distribution.

**Reasons for Choosing Methods:**
- The `address` feature is categorical, and the max/min ratio method provides a clear understanding of the distribution differences between categories.
- The Jensen-Shannon Divergence method from the reference literature offers a sophisticated approach to detect subtle distribution biases, complementing the max/min ratio analysis.

Next, I'll extract the method for Jensen-Shannon Divergence from the reference literature and proceed with executing the selected methods.

### Tool Calls:
- **Tool Name**: get_reference_method_by_id
  - **Tool ID**: call_UnmS9FwvKfiTyfUPOHC1qsmO
  - **Arguments**: {"references_file_path": "source_files/references.json", "id_to_retrieve": "A-0-8"}

You MUST generate executable code based on this method ASAP and call the execute_python_code function to execute it.

### Results of Bias Detection

1. **Max/Min Ratio Method:**
   - The max/min ratio for the `address` feature (urban vs rural) is approximately 3.49.
   - According to the bias level thresholds, a ratio greater than 2 indicates a Level 2 bias, which represents minimal bias.

2. **Jensen-Shannon Divergence Method:**
   - The calculated Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is approximately 0.03.
   - A higher JSD value indicates a stronger bias. However, in practical terms, JSD values close to 0 suggest minimal deviation from the expected distribution.

### Visualization Plan
To visualize the distribution of the `address` feature, I will create a pie chart to graphically represent the proportions of urban and rural students.

Next, I'll proceed to generate this visualization.

### Summary of Bias Detection and Analysis

**Dataset:** `Student Performance.csv`

**Relevant Feature:** `address` (Urban vs Rural)

**Type of Bias Detected:** Distribution

**Tools and Methods Used:**
1. **Max/Min Ratio Method:** 
   - Result: Ratio of 3.49
   - Interpretation: Indicates a minimal bias (Level 2), suggesting slightly uneven representation but not alarming.

2. **Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD):**
   - Result: JSD of 0.03
   - Interpretation: Suggests minimal deviation from a uniform distribution, reinforcing the finding of minimal bias.

**Visualization:**
- A pie chart of the `address` distribution has been created to provide a visual representation of the urban and rural student proportions.

### Interpretation and Recommendations
- **Bias Level:** Minimal Bias (Level 2)
  - Based on the analysis, the representation of urban and rural students is slightly uneven but does not indicate a severe bias. The dataset is reasonably balanced with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.
- **Recommendations:** You can use this dataset confidently, but be aware of the slight imbalance in certain analyses or decisions.

The pie chart visualization has been saved at `generated_files/address_distribution_pie_chart.png` for your reference.

Now, I will generate a detailed detection report.
