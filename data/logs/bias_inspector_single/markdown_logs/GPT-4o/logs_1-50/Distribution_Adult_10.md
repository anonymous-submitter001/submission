### Message Content:

Thank you for providing the details of your task. To determine if there are any notable patterns or biases in the distribution of the "native country" feature within your dataset, we will:

1. **Understand the Dataset**: Load and explore the dataset to identify the characteristics of the "native country" feature.
2. **Select Detection Methods**: 
   - Use the toolset to check the distribution bias in the "native country" feature.
   - Review reference literature to find additional methods for analyzing distribution bias.
3. **Visualize the Data**: Create visualizations to better understand the distribution of the "native country" feature.
4. **Summarize the Results**: Provide a detailed explanation of the bias level, its implications, and recommendations.

Let's begin by loading the dataset and exploring the features.

### Plan for Detecting Distribution Bias in "native-country" Feature:

1. **Toolset Methods**:
   - **Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric**: This method will help assess the uncertainty and balance in the categorical distribution of "native-country."
   - **Max/Min Ratio**: This method will analyze the relative frequency distribution of categories.
   - **Gini Index**: It will provide insights into the inequality within the distribution.

2. **Reference Literature Method**:
   - **Chi-Square Test (Reference A-0-6)**: Calculate the Chi-Square value to assess whether the observed distribution significantly deviates from a uniform distribution.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Use pie charts and heatmaps to visualize the distribution of the "native-country" feature.

Let's start by applying the distribution bias analysis using the toolset methods and then visualize the results. Following that, we'll execute the Chi-Square test method from the reference literature.

### Workflow Summary and Detailed Analysis

#### Dataset Analyzed:
- **Dataset Path**: `source_files/Adult.csv`
- **Feature Examined**: "native-country"

#### Bias Detection Methods and Results:

1. **Bias Type**: Distribution
2. **Relevant Feature**: "native-country"

3. **Toolset Analysis**:
   - **Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric**: 
     - Balance: 0.175
     - Shannon Entropy: 0.944
     - **Interpretation**: The balance metric is low, indicating a high level of imbalance in the distribution of native countries.
   - **Max/Min Ratio**: 
     - Max/Min Ratio: 29170.0
     - **Interpretation**: A very high max/min ratio suggests extreme concentration in certain categories, indicating a significant distribution bias.
   - **Gini Index**: 
     - Corrected Gini Index: 0.199
     - Adjusted Gini Index: 0.203
     - **Interpretation**: The Gini Index indicates inequality in the distribution, supporting the presence of bias.

4. **Reference Literature Method (Chi-Square Test)**:
   - The Chi-Square test was applied to compare observed frequencies with expected uniform distribution. However, the execution results were not available, indicating a need for further examination.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - **Pie Chart**: [View Pie Chart](generated_files/native_country_pie_chart.png)
   - **Heatmap**: [View Heatmap](generated_files/native_country_heatmap.png)

#### Bias Level Assessment:
Based on the toolset results, the overall bias level in the "native-country" feature is categorized as "Extreme Bias." This suggests that the dataset may not be well-balanced in terms of geographic representation, and significant variations are present.

**Recommendations**:
- Consider rebalancing the dataset to ensure better geographic representation.
- Be cautious when using this feature in analysis, as the bias may significantly influence outcomes.

Let's generate a detailed bias detection report.

  - **Chi-Square Test**: The execution results were not available, indicating a need for further examination.

### Bias Level Assessment:
The overall bias level in the "native-country" feature is categorized as "Extreme Bias." This suggests that the dataset may not be well-balanced in terms of geographic representation, and significant variations are present. Based on these findings, I recommend considering rebalancing the dataset to ensure better geographic representation and being cautious when using this feature in analysis.

I've also generated a detailed bias detection report, which you can [view here](generated_files/native_country_bias_report.pdf).

If you have any additional questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
