### Message Content:

To explore the potential influence between "education" and "race" in the dataset at "source_files/Adult.csv," we need to conduct a correlation analysis between these two categorical features. Here's how we'll proceed:

### Step 1: Understand and Load the Dataset
- **Dataset**: Load the dataset from "source_files/Adult.csv" and examine its structure to ensure the relevant features are present.

### Step 2: Preprocess the Data
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract the "education" and "race" columns for analysis.
- **Cleaning**: Ensure there are no missing or invalid values in the selected columns.

### Step 3: Detection and Analysis Methods
- **Toolset Methods**: We’ll use the following methods from the toolset:
  - **Cramér's V**: This method is suitable for measuring the association between two categorical variables. It will allow us to understand the strength of the association between "education" and "race."
  - **Elift**: This method provides a ratio of confidence levels, helping us see if education levels have a preference for specific races or vice versa.
  - **Statistical Parity and Z-scores**: This will enable us to examine if certain races have significantly different proportions in education levels.

### Step 4: Visualization
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: This will help visualize the distribution and relationship between "education" and "race."

### Step 5: References for Additional Insights
- I will review the reference literature to see if there are any additional relevant methods we should incorporate.

### Step 6: Summarization and Reporting
- Summarize the findings based on the analysis results.
- Generate a detailed report, including visualizations and recommendations.

I will first load the dataset and extract the necessary features. Let's start with that.

### DECISION ANALYSIS

The analysis of the relationship between "education" and "race" in the dataset has been completed. Here's a summary of the findings:

1. **Bias Type**: Correlation
2. **Relevant Features**: Education, Race

#### Detection Results:
- **Cramér's V**: 0.0749
  - This value suggests a very weak association between "education" and "race".
- **Max Elift**: 6.437
  - Indicates a significant correlation, suggesting that certain education levels may have a strong preference for specific races or vice versa.
- **Max Z-value from Statistical Parity**: 0.498
  - This suggests a moderate level of difference in proportions of education levels across races.

#### Bias Level Assessment:
- **Cramér's V** indicates a minimal bias (Level 2).
- **Elift** suggests an extreme bias (Level 5).
- **Statistical Parity** shows a moderate bias (Level 3).

Overall, the analysis reveals varying levels of bias across different metrics. The most concerning finding is from the Elift measure, which indicates a significant correlation between education and race.

### Visualization:
A stacked bar chart has been created to visually represent the distribution of education levels across different races. You can find the visualization here: ![Stacked Bar Chart](generated_files/education_race_stacked_bar_chart.png).

### Feedback to User:
Based on my analysis, there appears to be a significant correlation between "education" and "race" as indicated by the Elift measure. While Cramér's V suggests a minimal association, the Elift value points to a potential bias that could impact interpretations and applications of the data. I recommend careful consideration of these findings, particularly in contexts where racial equity is a concern. The dataset may require adjustments or additional analysis to mitigate this bias.

I'll proceed to generate a detailed report based on these findings.

### COMPLETE TASK

I have completed the bias detection and analysis for the relationship between "education" and "race" in the dataset. Here’s a detailed summary of the findings:

1. **Bias Type**: Correlation
2. **Relevant Features**: Education, Race
3. **Detailed Results**:
   - **Cramér's V**: 0.0749 indicates a very weak association, suggesting minimal bias.
   - **Max Elift**: 6.437 reveals a significant correlation, pointing to extreme bias.
   - **Max Z-value**: 0.498 shows a moderate level of bias in statistical parity.

### Overall Bias Level: 
The analysis suggests differing degrees of bias across metrics, with the Elift measure indicating a significant correlation. This implies that certain education levels may be disproportionately represented among different races.

### Visualization:
A stacked bar chart was created to visualize the relationship between education and race, providing a clearer picture of the distribution across these categories.

### Recommendations:
I recommend careful consideration of these findings, particularly in contexts where racial equity is a concern. The dataset may require adjustments or additional analysis to mitigate this bias. The generated PDF report contains all the details and visualizations and can be accessed [here](generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf).
