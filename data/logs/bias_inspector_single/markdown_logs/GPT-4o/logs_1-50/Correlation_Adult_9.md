### Message Content:

Great task! We need to determine if there's a correlation between individuals' native countries and their income levels in the dataset provided at `source_files/Adult.csv`. Here's how we'll approach this:

### Detection Task:
- **Objective:** Analyze if individuals from certain countries are more likely to earn higher wages.
- **Dataset Path:** `source_files/Adult.csv`
- **Features of Interest:** Native country, Income

### Plan for Execution:

#### Understanding and Preprocessing the Dataset:
1. **Load and Inspect Features:** Load the dataset and list the features to ensure we have the correct columns.
2. **Clean Data:** Check for missing or invalid values in the relevant columns (Native country and Income).

#### Detection and Analysis Methods:
- **Correlation Analysis:** Since "Native country" is a categorical variable and "Income" is also categorical, we'll evaluate their correlation using methods from both the available toolset and reference literature.

#### Methods from Toolset:
1. **Cramér's V Analysis:** This measures the association between two categorical variables.
2. **Elift Analysis:** This calculates the correlation between two categorical variables.
3. **Statistical Parity:** This assesses if certain groups (countries) have significantly different proportions of higher income.

#### Methods from Reference Literature:
To ensure a comprehensive analysis, I'll review the reference literature for additional methods, focusing on those with IDs ending in digits greater than 5. Let's proceed to gather these references.

#### Visualization:
- Use stacked bar charts and grouped bar charts to visually represent the correlation between Native country and Income levels.

#### Result Summarization:
- Compile all findings into a detailed summary and generate a bias detection report.

Let's begin by loading the dataset and inspecting the features. Then I'll retrieve the relevant reference intentions.

### Message Content:

The Pearson's Chi-square test has been successfully executed with the following results:

- **Chi-square Statistic:** 317.23
- **p-value:** \(2.21 \times 10^{-44}\)

### Interpretation:
The extremely low p-value suggests that we can reject the null hypothesis of independence between `native-country` and `income`. This indicates a significant correlation bias between these two features.

### Next Steps:
1. **Execute Cramér's V Analysis** to further assess the association strength.
2. **Conduct Elift Analysis** to understand the correlation using another measure.
3. **Apply Statistical Parity Analysis** to see if certain countries have different income distributions.

Let's proceed with these analyses.

### Message Content:

Here are the results from the additional analyses conducted:

### Results:
1. **Cramér's V Analysis:**
   - **Cramér's V Value:** 0.0987
   - Interpretation: This value indicates a very weak association between `native-country` and `income`.

2. **Elift Analysis:**
   - **Max Elift Value:** 1.7383
   - Interpretation: The Elift value indicates a moderate correlation between `native-country` and `income`.

3. **Statistical Parity Analysis:**
   - **Max Z-value:** 0.5632
   - Interpretation: This Z-value suggests a moderate difference in income distribution among different countries.

### Summary:
- **Bias Type:** Correlation
- **Relevant Features:** Native-country, Income

### Bias Level Evaluation:
- **Chi-square Test:** Significant correlation bias (extremely low p-value).
- **Cramér's V:** Very weak correlation.
- **Elift Analysis:** Moderate correlation.
- **Statistical Parity:** Moderate difference.

**Overall Bias Level:** The dataset shows a moderate level of bias based on the combination of these analyses. Let's generate a detailed bias detection report, including visualizations, to provide a comprehensive view.

### Visualization:
We will create visualizations to support our analysis:
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: To visually represent the distribution of income across different native countries.

Let's proceed with creating the visualizations and generating the report.

### COMPLETE TASK

The bias detection task is complete, and the detailed report has been generated. Here's a summary of the findings:

1. **Bias Type:** Correlation
2. **Relevant Features:** Native-country, Income
3. **Results:**
   - **Pearson's Chi-square Test:** Showed significant correlation bias with a very low p-value (2.21e-44).
   - **Cramér's V Analysis:** Indicated a very weak correlation (0.0987).
   - **Elift Analysis:** Suggested a moderate correlation (1.7383).
   - **Statistical Parity Analysis:** Showed moderate differences in income distribution (Max Z-value: 0.5632).

### Feedback on Bias Levels:
- **Moderate Bias:** Based on my analysis, the features `native-country` and `income` show a moderate level of bias. The tools I used suggest some bias is present. For example, while the Chi-square test indicates significant correlation, Cramér's V shows a weak correlation, and Elift suggests a moderate level. These results should be considered in certain applications, and I recommend further thought before proceeding.

### Recommendations:
- Consider the moderate correlation bias when using the dataset for decision-making processes. It might influence the analysis outcome, especially in contexts sensitive to income distributions across different countries.
