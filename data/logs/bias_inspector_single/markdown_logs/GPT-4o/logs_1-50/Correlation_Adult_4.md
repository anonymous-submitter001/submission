### Message Content:

To analyze whether educational attainment has a direct influence on income, we need to look at the correlation between the two features: "education" (categorical) and "income" (numerical). The task involves examining the potential correlation bias between these two features.

Let's break down the steps for this task:

1. **Understanding the Dataset**: Load the dataset to identify the relevant features (education and income).
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean the data if needed, especially focusing on the selected columns.
3. **Detection and Analysis**: 
   - Use tools to analyze the correlation between the categorical feature "education" and the numerical feature "income".
   - Look at existing literature to identify additional or complementary methods that can provide insights into this relationship.
4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to illustrate the correlation findings, such as box plots or scatter plots.
5. **Summarization**: Compile the results and provide a detailed summary of the findings in terms of correlation and bias levels.

Let's begin by loading the dataset and identifying the features available to us.

### Message Content:

We have successfully identified the features in the dataset. For our analysis, the relevant features are "education" (categorical) and "income" (numerical).

### Plan for Analyzing Correlation: 

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Ensure the relevant features ("education" and "income") are clean and ready for analysis.

2. **Detection and Analysis**:
   - **Toolset Methods**:
     - Use `categorical_numerical_correlation_max_abs_mean` to measure the correlation between the categorical feature "education" and the numerical feature "income."
     - Use `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d` to calculate Cohen's d for effect size between "education" and "income."
   - **Reference Literature Methods**:
     - Retrieve and review methods from literature to identify any additional relevant techniques for measuring this correlation.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of income across different education levels.

4. **Summarization**:
   - Compile results from different methods and provide an interpretation of the correlation and its significance.

Let's proceed by cleaning the relevant columns if necessary and then executing the correlation analysis methods.

### Message Content:

It seems there was an error with the column names. The correct column names from the dataset are " education" and " income" (note the leading space). Let's address this and proceed with the correlation analysis.

Additionally, I retrieved a list of intentions from the reference literature. Here are a few that seem relevant:

- **B-01-6**: Detect whether there is correlation bias between a categorical feature and a numerical feature using Statistical Fairness analysis within the income distribution domain.
- **B-01-10**: Detect whether there is correlation bias between a categorical feature and a numerical feature using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) method within the domain of healthcare data analysis.
- **B-01-17**: Detect whether there is correlation bias between a categorical feature and a numerical feature using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) within the decision-making domain.

Let's retrieve the methods for these references to incorporate them into our analysis plan.

### Message Content:

We have obtained methods from the literature to analyze the correlation bias between education and income. Let's incorporate these methods into our plan:

### Methods from Literature:
1. **Statistical Fairness Analysis (B-01-6):**
   - Convert the numerical feature "income" into a binary label (e.g., high income vs. low income).
   - Calculate the Risk Difference (RD) between education levels.
   - Assess the RD to determine bias.

2. **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) (B-01-10):**
   - Standardize the income feature.
   - One-hot encode the education feature.
   - Calculate HSIC to measure correlation bias.

3. **SHAP Values (B-01-17):**
   - Calculate SHAP values for income based on education.
   - Compare SHAP value differences between education categories to assess bias.

Since we have encountered an error with the column names, let's first clean and prepare the correct columns " education" and " income" from the dataset. Then, we will execute the correlation analysis using the toolset methods and the methods obtained from the literature.

It seems we encountered an error indicating that the " income" feature is not recognized as a numerical feature.

### Message Content:

The "income" column appears to be categorical (with values like "<=50K" and ">50K") rather than numerical. To proceed with the correlation analysis, we need to convert this column into a numerical format. We can encode "<=50K" as 0 and ">50K" as 1. 

Let's perform this conversion and then execute the correlation analysis again.

### Message Content:

The `categorical_numerical_correlation_max_abs_mean` method returned a Max Absolute N Value of approximately 1.17, indicating a correlation bias level of 5, which is considered extreme bias. However, the `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d` method failed because it requires the categorical feature to have exactly two categories, which is not the case for the "education" feature.

### Next Steps:

1. **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)**: Let's implement the HSIC method from the literature to assess correlation bias.
2. **SHAP Values**: Use SHAP values to further analyze the correlation bias.

I will proceed with the implementation of the HSIC method and SHAP values analysis. Let's start with HSIC.

### Message Content:

The Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) value obtained is approximately \(2.01 \times 10^{-12}\), which is very close to zero. This suggests a negligible correlation bias between education and income when using this specific method.

Next, let's proceed with the SHAP values analysis to further understand the correlation bias between these features.

### Message Content:

It appears that the SHAP library is not available in the current environment, which prevents us from executing the SHAP values analysis. However, we can still summarize our findings based on the analyses conducted so far.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Max Absolute N Value Method**:
   - The Max Absolute N Value was approximately 1.17, indicating an extreme correlation bias level of 5 between education and income.

2. **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)**:
   - The HSIC value was approximately \(2.01 \times 10^{-12}\), suggesting negligible correlation bias between education and income using this method.

### Conclusion:

- The findings demonstrate a significant variance in the assessment of correlation bias between education and income depending on the method used. While one method indicates extreme bias, another suggests minimal bias.
- This discrepancy highlights the complexity of bias detection and the importance of using multiple methods to gain a comprehensive understanding.

I will generate a detailed report based on these findings.
