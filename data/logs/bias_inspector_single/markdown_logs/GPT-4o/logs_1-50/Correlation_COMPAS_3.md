### Message Content:

Hello! I specialize in bias detection and analysis for structured datasets. I can help you detect and analyze bias in your dataset, whether you're interested in correlations between features or in understanding the distribution of a particular feature. You can provide me with a specific task and the dataset you'd like to analyze, and I'll assist you with a detailed bias analysis and report.

How can I assist you today?

### Message Content:

Great! We’ll be analyzing the relationship between ethnicity and the recommended supervision levels in the dataset located at `source_files/COMPAS.csv`. This involves examining whether certain ethnic groups are more likely to receive higher or lower recommended supervision levels.

Let's outline the plan for this task:

### Plan

1. **Dataset Understanding and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset and extract the relevant features: Ethnicity and Recommended Supervision Level.
   - Clean the data if necessary to handle missing or invalid values.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Since both features are categorical, we will check for correlation using methods like Cramér's V and Elift from our toolset.
   - **Reference Literature**: I will also review reference literature to identify any additional methods that may be applicable, focusing on references with an ending digit greater than 5.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the relationship between ethnicity and supervision levels using a stacked bar chart to provide a clear picture of the distribution across different groups.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize the findings, clearly explaining the bias type, relevant features, and bias level. Provide recommendations based on the analysis.

I will start by loading the dataset and extracting the necessary columns. Let's proceed with that.

### Message Content:

The relevant features for the analysis are `Ethnic_Code_Text` and `RecSupervisionLevelText`. I will extract these columns to create a focused dataset for our analysis.

Next, I'll check the reference literature to identify any additional methods that might be applicable for this task. After that, I will proceed with extracting the columns.

### Message Content:

I have successfully extracted and cleaned the relevant columns (`Ethnic_Code_Text` and `RecSupervisionLevelText`). Now, we have a cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

### Selected Methods for Analysis:

1. **Toolset:**
   - **Cramér's V and Elift**: These will help us measure the association between the two categorical variables: ethnicity and recommended supervision level.

2. **Reference Literature:**
   - **Statistical Parity Analysis** (from reference B-00-11): This method will help us calculate the statistical distance between the conditional distributions of supervision levels given different ethnicities using J-divergence.

Let's start by applying the Cramér's V and Elift methods to the dataset using our toolset. After that, we'll execute the code for the Statistical Parity Analysis method from the literature.

### Analysis and Results

#### Bias Type: Correlation
- **Relevant Features**: Ethnicity (`Ethnic_Code_Text`) and Recommended Supervision Level (`RecSupervisionLevelText`)

#### Toolset Results:
1. **Cramér's V**: The correlation coefficient is 0.1804.
   - **Interpretation**: This suggests a minimal association between ethnicity and the recommended supervision level, aligning with Level 2 (Minimal Bias).

2. **Elift**: The maximum Elift value is 5.2788.
   - **Interpretation**: This indicates a significant correlation between the two features, suggesting a Level 5 (Extreme Bias).

#### Reference Literature Results:
- **Statistical Parity Analysis (J-divergence)**:
  - The J-divergence values between ethnic groups range from minimal differences (e.g., 0.4523 between African-American and Native American) to extremely large differences (e.g., 4,246,575,343.0 between Native American and Oriental).
  - **Interpretation**: These values indicate varying levels of bias, with some ethnic pairs showing minimal bias and others showing extreme bias.

#### Visualization:
- I will create a stacked bar chart to visualize the distribution of recommended supervision levels across different ethnic groups.

Let's proceed to create the visualization and finalize the detection report.

### Summary of Findings

Based on the analysis of the relationship between ethnicity and recommended supervision levels in the dataset, here are the key insights:

1. **Bias Type**: Correlation
2. **Relevant Features**: Ethnicity (`Ethnic_Code_Text`) and Recommended Supervision Level (`RecSupervisionLevelText`)

3. **Toolset Results**:
   - **Cramér's V**: A value of 0.1804 indicates minimal association between ethnicity and recommended supervision level, suggesting minimal bias.
   - **Elift**: The maximum Elift value of 5.2788 indicates significant correlation, suggesting extreme bias.

4. **Reference Literature Results**:
   - **Statistical Parity Analysis (J-divergence)**: There is a wide range of J-divergence values, indicating varying levels of bias across different ethnic groups, from minimal to extreme.

5. **Visualization**:
   - A stacked bar chart was created to visualize the distribution of recommended supervision levels across different ethnic groups.

6. **Interpretation of Bias Severity**:
   - Overall, the dataset exhibits both minimal and extreme bias levels depending on the method used.
   - The extreme biases detected by Elift and J-divergence highlight potential concerns regarding fairness in decision-making processes.

7. **Recommendations**:
   - Given the significant biases detected, especially by Elift and some J-divergence comparisons, careful consideration and potential adjustments may be necessary to ensure fairness.

The detailed findings and visualizations are documented in the [bias detection report](sandbox:/mnt/data/generated_files/ethnicity_supervision_bias_report.pdf).
