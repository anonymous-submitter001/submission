### Message Content:

Thank you for providing the task and dataset path. We'll be analyzing whether the age distribution in the dataset "source_files/MIMIC-IV.csv" is evenly spread or skewed towards certain age groups.

I will proceed with the following steps to fulfill this task:

1. **Understand the Dataset**: Load the dataset and identify the features, particularly focusing on the "Age" feature.
2. **Select Bias Detection Methods**:
   - I will review both the available toolset and reference literature to select appropriate methods for detecting distribution bias in the "Age" feature.
3. **Execute the Analysis**: Perform the analysis using the selected methods to assess the distribution of the "Age" feature.
4. **Visualize and Summarize Findings**: Create visualizations to support the analysis and provide a detailed summary.

Let's start by loading the dataset and identifying the features.

- **Message ID**: run-f53405e9-0451-4e5a-84b9-4375981279b6-0

### Message Content:

The dataset contains the following features: `admission_type`, `hospital_expire_flag`, `admission_location`, `discharge_location`, `patient_insurance`, `patient_lang`, `patient_marital`, `patient_race`, `patient_gender`, and `patient_age`.

Our focus will be on the `patient_age` feature, which we need to analyze for distribution bias.

### Plan for Bias Detection:

1. **Detection Method Selection**:
   - **Toolset**: I will use tools like numerical distribution skewness, kurtosis, and Z-score outlier detection to evaluate the bias in the age distribution.
   - **Literature Reference**: I will check the reference literature for additional methods that might be suitable for detecting distribution bias in numerical data, ensuring I select a reference with an ending digit greater than 5.

2. **Execution**:
   - Execute the selected methods from both the toolset and the literature references.
   
3. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations such as histograms or box plots to visually assess the age distribution.

4. **Result Summary**:
   - Summarize the findings from both the analysis and the visualizations.

Let's first retrieve reference literature to see if there are additional methods we can use.

### Analysis Summary

1. **Bias Type**: Distribution
2. **Relevant Feature**: `patient_age`

3. **Detection Methods and Results**:
   - **Skewness**: The calculated skewness value of the "patient_age" feature is approximately -0.1917, indicating a slight skew to the left, but it is very close to zero, suggesting a relatively symmetric distribution.
     - **Bias Level**: Level 1 (No Bias)
   - **Kurtosis**: The kurtosis value is approximately -0.8396, showing platykurtic distribution, which means it has lighter tails than a normal distribution.
     - **Bias Level**: Level 1 (No Bias)
   - **Z-score Outlier Detection**: The outlier percentage is 0.0%, indicating no significant outliers.
     - **Bias Level**: Level 1 (No Bias)
   - **Shannon Entropy Framework**: The calculated Shannon entropy is approximately 2.2515, close to the maximum possible entropy of 2.3026 for the chosen bin configuration, indicating a fairly even distribution.
     - **Bias Level**: Level 1 (No Bias)

4. **Visualizations**:
   - Histogram and box plot images were generated to visually support the findings, showing an even distribution of ages.

5. **Overall Bias Level Summary**:
   The analysis indicates that there is no significant distribution bias in the "patient_age" feature. The age distribution appears to be relatively even and symmetric, with no significant skewness, kurtosis, or outliers detected.

### Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, you can confidently proceed with using the `patient_age` feature in your dataset. The distribution does not show any significant bias that would affect the reliability or validity of analyses that include this feature.

I will now generate a detailed detection report.

### Message Content:

The analysis of the "patient_age" feature in your dataset indicates no significant distribution bias. Here's a detailed summary of our findings:

- **Bias Type**: Distribution
- **Relevant Feature**: `patient_age`
- **Results**:
  - **Skewness**: The skewness value of -0.1917 indicates a very slight left skew, almost symmetric. This suggests no significant bias.
  - **Kurtosis**: The kurtosis value of -0.8396 indicates a platykurtic distribution (lighter tails), with no significant bias.
  - **Z-score Outlier Detection**: The outlier percentage is 0.0%, indicating no significant outliers.
  - **Shannon Entropy**: The calculated entropy of 2.2515 is very close to the maximum entropy of 2.3026, indicating a fairly even distribution.

Overall, the "patient_age" feature shows no significant bias, and you can confidently use it for further analysis.

I've also generated a detailed [PDF report](generated_files/age_distribution_bias_report.pdf) that includes visualizations and a comprehensive summary of the findings.

If you have any additional needs or other tasks, please let me know!
