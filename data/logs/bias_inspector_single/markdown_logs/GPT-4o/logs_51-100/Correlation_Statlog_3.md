### Message Content:

Thank you for providing the details. The task is to explore the relationship between the job type (profession) and credit risk classification in the dataset located at "source_files/Statlog.csv". This involves examining whether there is a significant correlation between these two categorical variables.

### DECISION ANALYSIS

I will now create a plan to execute this task which involves the following steps:
1. **Understanding the Dataset**: Load the dataset and identify the specific features related to job type and credit risk classification.
2. **Detection and Analysis Methods**: 
   - I will consider methods from the available toolset to perform correlation analysis on two categorical features.
   - Additionally, I'll consult reference literature to find methods that might be relevant and have an ending digit greater than 5.
3. **Visualization Approaches**: Use visualizations to support the analysis, such as stacked or grouped bar charts.
4. **Summarization and Reporting**: Summarize the findings and generate a detailed report.

Let's start by loading the dataset and identifying the relevant features.

### Plan and Method Selection

I've successfully extracted the relevant columns "Job" and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)" into a new dataset named "job_credit_risk_dataset.csv". Now, let's proceed with selecting methods to analyze the correlation between these two categorical features.

#### Toolset Method:
1. **Cramér's V**: This method measures the strength of association between two categorical variables. It provides a bias level based on the Cramér's V value.
   - I will use the `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v` tool for this analysis.

#### Reference Literature:
From the reference literature, I found relevant intentions for analyzing correlation bias between two categorical features. Specifically:
1. **Reference ID: B-00-7**: Detect whether there is correlation bias between two categorical features using Chi-Square test.
2. **Reference ID: B-00-10**: Detect whether there is correlation bias between two categorical features using Wasserstein-2 distance.

I will retrieve the methods for these references and implement them.

Let's proceed by retrieving the methods from the reference literature for the selected IDs.

### Code Implementation

Based on the methods retrieved from the reference literature, I will now implement the code for the Chi-Square test and the Wasserstein-2 distance to analyze the correlation between "Job" and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)". 

#### Chi-Square Test Implementation:
The Chi-Square test will involve constructing a contingency table and then calculating the Chi-Square statistic using the `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency` function.

#### Wasserstein-2 Distance Implementation:
The Wasserstein-2 distance will be calculated using the `scipy.stats.wasserstein_distance` function to evaluate distributional differences between categories.

Here is the code to execute these analyses:

### COMPLETE TASK

### Workflow Summary

1. **Dataset Preparation**: We extracted the relevant columns "Job" and "Credit risk (Good/Bad)" from the dataset located at "source_files/Statlog.csv" into a new dataset named "job_credit_risk_dataset.csv".

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods**:
   - **Chi-Square Test**: Implemented to measure the association between the two categorical variables. The Chi-Square Statistic is 1.885 with a p-value of 0.597, suggesting no significant association.
   - **Wasserstein-2 Distance**: Calculated to evaluate the distributional differences between categories. The Wasserstein-2 Distance is 0.574, indicating some level of distributional difference.
   - **Cramér's V**: Used to assess the strength of association. The value is 0.043, indicating a very weak association.

3. **Visualization**: A stacked bar chart was created to visually depict the relationship between job type and credit risk classification.

### Detailed Summary and Conclusions

- **Bias Type**: Correlation
- **Relevant Features**: Job, Credit risk (Good/Bad)
- **Bias Level**: 
  - **Chi-Square Test**: The p-value is quite high (0.597), which indicates that there is no significant association between the job type and credit risk classification.
  - **Wasserstein-2 Distance**: The distance value is 0.574, which suggests some distributional differences but not substantial.
  - **Cramér's V**: With a value of 0.043, it confirms a very weak association, supporting the findings from the Chi-Square test.

Based on my analysis, it appears that the features in this dataset show no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the Chi-Square test returned a p-value of 0.597, Cramér's V showed 0.043, and the Wasserstein-2 distance measured 0.574. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.

### Visualization and Report
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: A visual representation of the relationship between job type and credit risk classification is saved as "generated_files/job_credit_risk_stacked_bar.png".

Now, I will generate a detailed PDF report summarizing these findings.
