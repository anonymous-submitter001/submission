### Message Content:

Hello! I specialize in detecting and analyzing bias in structured datasets. I can help you with tasks such as identifying correlations between features, examining the distribution of a particular feature, and providing detailed analyses and visualizations.

If you have a specific dataset or task in mind, you can let me know, and we'll get started! If you're not sure where to begin, feel free to ask any questions you may have.

### Message Content:

To determine whether there is a connection between family support and academic performance in your dataset, we need to identify the relevant features and perform a correlation analysis:

1. **Relevant Features**:
   - One feature representing "family support."
   - Another feature representing "academic performance" (e.g., final grades).

2. **Task**: 
   - Analyze the correlation between family support and academic performance.

3. **Dataset**:
   - The path to your dataset is `source_files/Student Performance.csv`.

Now, I will start by examining the available features in your dataset and proceed with formulating a comprehensive plan for analyzing the correlation between these two features. Let's begin by retrieving the feature names from the dataset.

### Message Content:

The dataset contains various features, and for our analysis, we need to focus on the following:

1. **Family Support**: The feature `famsup` likely represents family support.
2. **Academic Performance**: The feature `G3` represents the final grade, which is a measure of academic performance.

### Detection Task:
- **Objective**: To analyze the correlation between `famsup` (family support) and `G3` (final grade).
- **Bias Type**: Correlation between one categorical feature (`famsup`) and one numerical feature (`G3`).

### Plan for Execution:
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and clean any missing or invalid values in the relevant columns (`famsup` and `G3`).

2. **Detection and Analysis** (Choose methods from both toolset and references):
   - **From Toolset**:
     - Use `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d` to analyze the correlation between `famsup` and `G3` using Cohen's d effect size.
     - Use `categorical_numerical_correlation_max_abs_mean` to calculate the maximum absolute mean for each category after standardization.
   - **From Reference Literature**:
     - Retrieve additional methods from the reference literature to ensure a comprehensive analysis.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations such as box plots to visually represent the correlation between family support and academic performance.

4. **Result Summarization**:
   - Summarize the findings and determine the bias level based on the results from different tools.

Let's move on to the next step by retrieving relevant methods from the reference literature.

### Message Content:

The analysis is now complete. Here's a detailed summary of the findings:

### Analysis Workflow:
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling any missing or invalid values in the `famsup` and `G3` columns.

2. **Detection and Analysis**:
   - **Cohen's d Effect Size**: The calculated Cohen's d value is approximately 0.080. According to the bias level guidelines, this falls into Level 1, indicating no bias.
   - **Max Absolute Mean**: The maximum absolute mean value is approximately 0.049, which also falls into Level 1, indicating no significant bias.
   - **HSIC Value**: The HSIC value calculated is approximately 9.765e-08, which is extremely low and indicates no significant correlation bias between `famsup` and `G3`.

### Bias Type:
- **Correlation**: We examined the correlation between the categorical feature `famsup` and the numerical feature `G3`.

### Relevant Feature(s):
- **Family Support**: `famsup`
- **Academic Performance**: `G3`

### Bias Level:
- **Overall Bias Level**: Based on the results from all methods, the bias level is Level 1, indicating no significant bias.

### Detailed Explanation to the User:
- **Based on my analysis, the feature of family support (`famsup`) and academic performance (`G3`) in this dataset show no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the Cohen's d effect size is approximately 0.080, the maximum absolute mean is approximately 0.049, and the HSIC value is approximately 9.765e-08. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.**

I will now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.
