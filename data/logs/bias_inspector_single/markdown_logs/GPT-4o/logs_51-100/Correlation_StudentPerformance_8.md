### Message Content:

Hello! I specialize in detecting and analyzing bias in structured datasets. If you have a dataset and want to explore potential biases, such as correlation or distribution bias, I can help you with that process. You just need to provide me with a clear detection task and the dataset to be analyzed. 

Examples of detection tasks include:
- "Is there a significant correlation between feature A and feature B in my dataset?"
- "Does the distribution of feature C in my dataset show any obvious bias?"

Feel free to let me know how I can assist you!

### Message Content:

Thank you for providing the task and dataset details. We will analyze the connection between students' participation in extracurricular activities and their father's occupation using the "activities" and "Fjob" features from the dataset.

### DECISION ANALYSIS

## Plan for Bias Detection:

### Understanding the Features:
- **activities**: Categorical feature indicating whether students participate in extracurricular activities.
- **Fjob**: Categorical feature representing the father's occupation.

### Detection and Analysis Methods:
1. **Toolset Methods:**
   - **Cram√©r's V Analysis**: This will help us measure the association between two categorical variables, "activities" and "Fjob". It is suitable since both features are categorical.
   - **Elift Analysis**: This will compute the Elift value to measure the correlation between the two categorical variables, providing a different perspective on their association.

2. **Reference Literature:**
   - I will review literature to find additional methods for analyzing the correlation between two categorical features. I'll select a method with a reference number ending in a digit greater than 5.

### Visualization:
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Visual representation of the relationship between "activities" and "Fjob".

### Result Summarization:
- Summarize the bias type, relevant features, bias level, and provide a detailed explanation of the findings.

Now, let's proceed with retrieving additional reference methods.

### COMPLETE TASK

Based on the analysis, here is the summary of the findings:

#### Overall Workflow:
1. **Data Understanding and Selection**: Analyzed the dataset "Student Performance.csv" to explore the relationship between the "activities" (extracurricular activities participation) and "Fjob" (father's occupation) features.
   
2. **Methodology**: 
   - **Cram√©r's V** and **Elift** from the toolset were used to measure the association between the two categorical features.
   - A Chi-Square test was performed based on the reference literature B-00-7, which is suitable for evaluating the association between two categorical variables.
   
3. **Visualization**: A stacked bar chart was generated to visually represent the relationship between "activities" and "Fjob".

#### Detailed Findings:
1. **Cram√©r's V Analysis**: 
   - Cram√©r's V value was 0.074, suggesting a very weak association between the students' extracurricular participation and their father's occupation.
   
2. **Elift Analysis**:
   - The Max Elift value was 1.115, indicating minimal correlation between the two features.

3. **Chi-Square Test**:
   - Chi-Square Statistic: 2.1639
   - p-value: 0.7056
   - Degrees of Freedom: 4
   - The p-value is significantly higher than 0.05, indicating no statistically significant association between the activities and father's job.

#### Bias Type: Correlation
- **Relevant Features**: "activities" and "Fjob"
- **Bias Level**: Based on all the methods used, the overall bias level can be categorized as Level 1 (No Bias).

#### Feedback to User:
- **Level 1 (No Bias)**:
  - Based on my analysis, it appears that the features "activities" and "Fjob" in this dataset show no significant bias from my perspective. 
  - The results from the tools I used, such as Cram√©r's V, Elift, and Chi-Square test, indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. 
  - For instance, Cram√©r's V returned a value of 0.074, Elift showed 1.115, and the Chi-Square test reported a p-value of 0.7056. 
  - I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.

#### Additional Explanation:
- The analysis indicates that there is no strong or significant connection between students participating in extracurricular activities and their father's occupation.
- The results across all methods consistently show a lack of significant correlation, which suggests that the dataset is unbiased in this context.

Now, I will generate a detailed detection report.
