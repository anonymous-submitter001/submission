### Message Content:

### Dataset Features
The dataset `source_files/Adult.csv` includes the following features:
- age
- workclass
- fnlwgt
- education
- education-num
- marital-status
- occupation
- relationship
- race
- sex
- capital-gain
- capital-loss
- hours-per-week
- native-country
- income

### Detection Task
We're interested in analyzing if the 'native-country' feature influences the 'income' outcome, which could imply a correlation bias between a categorical feature ('native-country') and another categorical feature ('income').

### Plan for Detection and Analysis
1. **Correlational Analysis**:
   - **Toolset**:
     - Use methods like Cramér's V, Elift, or Statistical Parity to determine if there is a correlation bias between 'native-country' and 'income'.
   - **Literature**:
     - Review the references and select relevant methods that explore correlation bias between two categorical features.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Utilize visualization tools such as bar charts or heatmaps to represent the distribution of income across different native countries.

3. **Result Summarization**:
   - Summarize the findings, categorize the bias level, and prepare a detection report.

Let's now select appropriate methods from the references that align with our task of detecting correlation bias between two categorical features. I'll choose a reference with an ending digit greater than 5 to get a unique method.

### Selected Method for Correlation Bias Detection
The chosen method involves using the Chi-Square test to detect any correlation bias between the 'native-country' and 'income' features. This method will help us determine if there's a significant association between these two features.

### Plan Execution
1. **Construct a Contingency Table**: Show the frequency distribution between 'native-country' and 'income'.
2. **Calculate Expected Frequencies**: Use the formula for expected frequencies.
3. **Compute Chi-Square Statistic**: Calculate using the formula and compare it with the critical value.
4. **Automate with Python**: Utilize the `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency()` function for computation.

Let's proceed with writing and executing the code based on this method.

### Results from Chi-Square Test
- **Chi-Square Statistic**: 317.23
- **p-value**: \(2.21 \times 10^{-44}\)

The results indicate a very low p-value, suggesting a significant association between the 'native-country' and 'income' features in the dataset. This suggests the presence of correlation bias.

### Next Steps
1. **Visualize the Distribution**: Create visualizations to further explore this relationship.
2. **Summarize the Findings**: Provide a detailed summary and categorize the bias level.

Let's proceed with visualizing the data to gain more insights. I will create a bar chart to display the distribution of income across different native countries.

### Message Content:

### Visualization
I have created a bar chart to visualize the distribution of income across different native countries. You can view the chart [here](generated_files/native_country_income_distribution.png).

### Conclusion and Summary
1. **Bias Type**: Correlation
2. **Relevant Features**: Native Country, Income
3. **Findings**:
   - **Chi-Square Test**: The Chi-Square statistic of 317.23 with an extremely low p-value indicates a significant association between the 'native-country' and 'income' features. This suggests a strong correlation bias.
   - **Visualization**: The bar chart provides a visual representation of the income distribution across different native countries, reinforcing the findings from the statistical analysis.

### Bias Level Assessment
Based on the Chi-Square test results and the significant p-value, the correlation bias between 'native-country' and 'income' can be considered significant. Therefore, it is advisable to assess the potential effects of this bias before using the dataset for any decision-making processes.

Let's now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.
