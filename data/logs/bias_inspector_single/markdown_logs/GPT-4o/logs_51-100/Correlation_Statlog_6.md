### Message Content:

Great! The task is to analyze whether there's a correlation between an individual's CreditHistory and their job type in the dataset located at `source_files/Statlog.csv`.

Let me first retrieve all the feature names from the dataset to identify the exact column names for CreditHistory and job type.

### Message Content:

The relevant features for our analysis are `Credit history` and `Job`. Since both of these features are categorical, we can proceed with correlation bias detection methods suitable for categorical data.

Next, I'll formulate a plan to execute the task by selecting the appropriate methods from both the available toolset and reference literature. Let me start by reviewing relevant methods in the literature.

### Overall Plan for Executing the Task

1. **Understanding and Preprocessing the Dataset:**
   - Extract the relevant features `Credit history` and `Job` from the dataset for analysis.

2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - **Chi-Square Test (Toolset and Reference B-00-7):** 
     - Construct a contingency table for the two categorical features.
     - Calculate the Chi-Square statistic to determine any significant association.
     - This will help identify whether there is a potential bias between `Credit history` and `Job`.
   - **Wasserstein-2 Distance (Reference B-00-10):** 
     - Calculate the Wasserstein-2 distance between the distributions of the categories in these features.
     - This will provide insight into the distributional differences and any significant bias between categories.

3. **Visualization Approaches:**
   - Use a grouped bar chart to visualize the distribution of `Credit history` across different `Job` types.

4. **Result Summarization:**
   - Summarize findings based on the bias levels indicated by both the Chi-Square test and Wasserstein-2 distance calculations.

I'll start by writing and executing the code for both methods, and visualizing the results. Let's proceed with the Chi-Square test first.

### Message Content:

The Wasserstein-2 distances between the encoded categories of `Credit history` and `Job` have been calculated. Here are some of the results:

- Distance between categories (1, 1): 0.976
- Distance between categories (1, 2): 1.119
- Distance between categories (2, 2): 0.773

These distances suggest the distributional differences between the categories. A higher Wasserstein-2 distance indicates a larger bias risk between the categories.

Finally, let's visualize the distribution of `Credit history` across different `Job` types using a grouped bar chart.

### COMPLETE TASK

#### Workflow Summary and Detailed Conclusions

1. **Task Definition:**
   - The objective was to analyze the correlation between an individual's CreditHistory and their job type using the dataset `source_files/Statlog.csv`.

2. **Dataset Understanding and Preprocessing:**
   - Extracted the features `Credit history` and `Job`.

3. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**
   - **Chi-Square Test:**
     - A contingency table was constructed, and the Chi-Square statistic was calculated.
     - The p-value was 0.397, indicating no significant association between `Credit history` and `Job`.
   - **Wasserstein-2 Distance:**
     - Calculated distances between encoded categories to assess distributional differences.
     - Results showed varying distances, with some pairs indicating a higher bias risk.

4. **Visualization:**
   - A grouped bar chart was created to visualize the distribution of `Credit history` across different `Job` types.

5. **Bias Type:** Correlation
6. **Relevant Features:** Credit history, Job

7. **Bias Level:**
   - **Chi-Square Test**: Level 1 (No Bias) due to the high p-value.
   - **Wasserstein-2 Distance**: Indicates varying bias levels, with some pairs suggesting higher risk.

8. **Findings Explanation:**
   - **Level 1 (No Bias)**: Based on the Chi-Square test, there is no significant correlation between `Credit history` and `Job`, suggesting no bias.
   - **Wasserstein-2 Distance**: Some category pairs show higher distributional differences, indicating potential bias.

9. **Visualizations:**
   - ![Grouped Bar Chart](generated_files/grouped_bar_chart_credit_history_job.png)

10. **Recommendations:**
    - The dataset appears suitable for use without significant concerns of bias between `Credit history` and `Job`.
    - For distributional differences indicated by Wasserstein-2, consider specific application contexts for further analysis.

I will now generate the detection report.
