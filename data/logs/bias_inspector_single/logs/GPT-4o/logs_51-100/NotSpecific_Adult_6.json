You can view the chart [here](generated_files/native_country_income_distribution.png).\n\n### Conclusion and Summary\n1. **Bias Type**: Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features**: Native Country, Income\n3. **Findings**:\n   - **Chi-Square Test**: The Chi-Square statistic of 317.23 with an extremely low p-value indicates a significant association between the 'native-country' and 'income' features. This suggests a strong correlation bias.\n   - **Visualization**: The bar chart provides a visual representation of the income distribution across different native countries, reinforcing the findings from the statistical analysis.\n\n### Bias Level Assessment\nBased on the Chi-Square test results and the significant p-value, the correlation bias between 'native-country' and 'income' can be considered significant. Therefore, it is advisable to assess the potential effects of this bias before using the dataset for any decision-making processes.\n\nLet's now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.",
