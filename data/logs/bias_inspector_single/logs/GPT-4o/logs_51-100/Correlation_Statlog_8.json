Here is a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n#### Dataset Analyzed:\n- **Path**: `source_files/Statlog.csv`\n- **Features Examined**: \n  - Number of people being liable to provide maintenance for (Dependents)\n  - Credit risk (Good/Bad)\n\n#### Types of Bias Detected:\n- **Correlation Bias**: Between two categorical features.\n\n#### Tools and Methods Used:\n- **Chi-Square Test**: Utilized Python's `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency()` function to assess the correlation.\n\n#### Results Obtained:\n- **Chi-Square Statistic**: 0.0\n- **p-value**: 1.0\n- **Degrees of Freedom**: 1\n- **Expected Frequencies**: \n  - For Dependents = 1, Credit Risk (Good): 253.5, (Bad): 591.5\n  - For Dependents = 2, Credit Risk (Good): 46.5, (Bad): 108.5\n\n#### Bias Level:\n- **Overall Bias Level**: Level 1 (No Bias)\n\n#### Visualization:\n- A stacked bar chart was created to visualize the distribution of credit risk outcomes based on the number of dependents.\n  - ![Stacked Bar Chart](generated_files/stacked_bar_chart_dependents_credit_risk.png)\n\n#### Natural Language Interpretation of the Bias Severity:\nBased on my analysis, it appears that the feature(s) in this dataset show no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the Chi-Square statistic is 0.0, and the p-value is 1.0, which suggests no significant association between the number of dependents and credit risk. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.\n\n#### Recommendations:\nYou can safely use this dataset in your analysis or modeling processes without worrying about bias between these features, as the analysis suggests there is no significant correlation bias.\n\nI'll now generate a detailed detection report in PDF format.",
