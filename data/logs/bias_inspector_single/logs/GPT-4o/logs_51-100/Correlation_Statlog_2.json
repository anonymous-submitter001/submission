Here's a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n#### Bias Type\n- **Correlation**\n\n#### Relevant Features\n- **Age in years** (Numerical)\n- **Credit risk (Good/Bad)** (Categorical)\n\n#### Tools and Results\n1. **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)**\n   - **HSIC Value**: \\(4.5087 \\times 10^{-7}\\)\n   - **Significant Bias Detected**: **False**\n   - This indicates no significant correlation bias according to the threshold (HSIC > 0.01).\n\n2. **Max Absolute Mean Method**\n   - **Max Absolute N Value**: 0.1392\n   - Based on the bias level thresholds, this suggests a minimal correlation bias between the features.\n\n3. **Cohen's d Method**\n   - **Effect Size (Cohen's d)**: 0.2000\n   - This value indicates a minimal correlation bias, as it falls within the range of Level 2.\n\n4. **Average Causal Effect (ACE)**\n   - **ACE Value**: 2.2609\n   - This indicates a moderate correlation bias between the features.\n\n#### Visualization\n- A box plot was generated to visualize the distribution of \"Age in years\" for each \"Credit risk\" category.\n  - ![Box Plot](generated_files/age_credit_risk_boxplot.png)\n\n#### Bias Level Summary\n- **Overall Bias Level**: The average results from the tools suggest a **minimal to moderate** bias level.\n\n#### User Feedback\n- **Minimal Bias**: In my view, the correlation between \"Age in years\" and \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\" exhibits minimal bias. The tools I used (e.g., HSIC, Max Absolute Mean, Cohen's d) suggest slight variations in certain metrics. For example, HSIC returned \\(4.5087 \\times 10^{-7}\\), Max Absolute Mean showed 0.1392, and Cohen's d measured 0.2000. While the bias is minor, I believe the dataset is still suitable for use.\n\nI will now generate a detailed bias detection report for you.",
