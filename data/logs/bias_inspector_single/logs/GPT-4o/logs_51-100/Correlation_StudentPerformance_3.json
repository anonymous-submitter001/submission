Here's a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n### Analysis Workflow:\n1. **Preprocessing**:\n   - Cleaned the dataset by handling any missing or invalid values in the `famsup` and `G3` columns.\n\n2. **Detection and Analysis**:\n   - **Cohen's d Effect Size**: The calculated Cohen's d value is approximately 0.080. According to the bias level guidelines, this falls into Level 1, indicating no bias.\n   - **Max Absolute Mean**: The maximum absolute mean value is approximately 0.049, which also falls into Level 1, indicating no significant bias.\n   - **HSIC Value**: The HSIC value calculated is approximately 9.765e-08, which is extremely low and indicates no significant correlation bias between `famsup` and `G3`.\n\n### Bias Type:\n- **Correlation**: We examined the correlation between the categorical feature `famsup` and the numerical feature `G3`.\n\n### Relevant Feature(s):\n- **Family Support**: `famsup`\n- **Academic Performance**: `G3`\n\n### Bias Level:\n- **Overall Bias Level**: Based on the results from all methods, the bias level is Level 1, indicating no significant bias.\n\n### Detailed Explanation to the User:\n- **Based on my analysis, the feature of family support (`famsup`) and academic performance (`G3`) in this dataset show no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the Cohen's d effect size is approximately 0.080, the maximum absolute mean is approximately 0.049, and the HSIC value is approximately 9.765e-08. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.**\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.",
