The Chi-Square Statistic is 1.885 with a p-value of 0.597, suggesting no significant association.\n   - **Wasserstein-2 Distance**: Calculated to evaluate the distributional differences between categories. The Wasserstein-2 Distance is 0.574, indicating some level of distributional difference.\n   - **Cramér's V**: Used to assess the strength of association. The value is 0.043, indicating a very weak association.\n\n3. **Visualization**: A stacked bar chart was created to visually depict the relationship between job type and credit risk classification.\n\n### Detailed Summary and Conclusions\n\n- **Bias Type**: Correlation\n- **Relevant Features**: Job, Credit risk (Good/Bad)\n- **Bias Level**: \n  - **Chi-Square Test**: The p-value is quite high (0.597), which indicates that there is no significant association between the job type and credit risk classification.\n  - **Wasserstein-2 Distance**: The distance value is 0.574, which suggests some distributional differences but not substantial.\n  - **Cramér's V**: With a value of 0.043, it confirms a very weak association, supporting the findings from the Chi-Square test.\n\nBased on my analysis, it appears that the features in this dataset show no significant bias from my perspective. The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the Chi-Square test returned a p-value of 0.597, Cramér's V showed 0.043, and the Wasserstein-2 distance measured 0.574. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.\n\n### Visualization and Report\n- **Stacked Bar Chart**: A visual representation of the relationship between job type and credit risk classification is saved as \"generated_files/job_credit_risk_stacked_bar.png\".\n\nNow, I will generate a detailed PDF report summarizing these findings.",
