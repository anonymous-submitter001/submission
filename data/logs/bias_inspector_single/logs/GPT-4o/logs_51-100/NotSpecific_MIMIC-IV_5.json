Here's a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n### Bias Analysis Summary:\n- **Type of Bias:** Correlation\n- **Relevant Features:** \n  - Numerical: patient_age\n  - Categorical: admission_type\n- **Analysis Results:**\n  - **HSIC Value:** \\(9.75 \\times 10^{-7}\\) - Indicates no significant correlation bias.\n  - **Z-scores:** Mostly close to zero, with slight variations seen in \"AMBULATORY OBSERVATION.\"\n  - **Cohen's d:** The highest value is \\(0.63\\), suggesting a small to medium effect size.\n  - **Standardized Difference:** The highest is \\(1.37\\), which points to minimal bias.\n  \n### Conclusion:\n- **Level 2 (Minimal Bias):** The analysis suggests that the correlation between age and admission type shows minimal bias. This means the dataset is generally reliable for analyzing decision-making or resource allocation without significant age-related bias.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- You can confidently use this dataset for further analysis, keeping in mind the slight variations in bias for specific admission types.\n\n### Visualizations:\n- A box plot illustrating the distribution of patient ages across different admission types has been included in the report.\n\nYou can download the detailed [Bias Detection Report](generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf).\n\nIf there are any additional needs or tasks you'd like me to assist with, please let me know!",
