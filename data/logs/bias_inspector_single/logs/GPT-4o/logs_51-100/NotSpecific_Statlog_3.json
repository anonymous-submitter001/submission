For instance, the Balance Metric showed a value of 0.71, indicating moderate bias, while the Max/Min Ratio and Relative Risk analysis revealed significant bias, with a normalized bias score of 28.64.\n\nThis level of bias suggests that certain job categories are more prevalent than others, which could impact any analysis or decisions based on this dataset.
