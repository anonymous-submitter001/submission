This could be considered in further studies or applications.\n\n5. **Visualization:** A box plot was created to visualize the age distribution across the hospital mortality flag.\n\n6. **Recommendations:** While the HSIC analysis indicates minimal bias, the mean age analysis suggests that age might still play a role in mortality outcomes. Further statistical analysis might be warranted to explore this relationship in more detail.\n\nThe comprehensive report, including the detailed analysis and visualizations, has been compiled into a PDF: [MIMIC_IV_Age_Mortality_Report.pdf](generated_files/MIMIC_IV_Age_Mortality_Report.pdf).\n\nPlease let me know if there are any additional tasks or if you have other needs!",
