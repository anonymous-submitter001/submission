This indicates that attending extra paid classes does not have a significant correlation with higher final grades.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Given the analysis, there seems to be no significant bias in the dataset regarding the impact of extra paid classes on final grades. You can proceed with confidence in using this dataset for further analysis or decision-making related to academic performance.\n\nI will now generate a detailed bias detection report.",
