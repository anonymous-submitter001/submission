We'll use the `numerical_distribution_skewness` tool.\n  - **Kurtosis**: This will measure the tails' heaviness, providing insights into outlier presence. We'll use the `numerical_distribution_kurtosis` tool.\n  - **Z-score Outlier Detection**: To quantify outliers and assess their impact. We'll use the `numerical_distribution_outlier` tool.\n  - **Quantile Deviation**: To measure the spread and understand the variability in \"age\". We'll use the `numerical_distribution_quantile_deviation` tool.\n\nLet's begin by loading the dataset and performing the necessary analyses.",

The results from various tools consistently indicate minimal to no significant bias in the distribution of \"age.\"\n\n#### Feedback for the User\n- **Level 2 (Minimal Bias)**: In my view, the \"age\" feature exhibits minimal bias. The skewness and quantile deviation suggest slight variations, but the overall distribution remains balanced. The kurtosis and outlier percentage indicate no significant issues.\n\nGiven these insights, you can confidently proceed with using this dataset, paying minimal attention to specific scenarios where age distribution might be a concern.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will generate a detailed detection report including all findings, visualizations, and recommendations.\n\nLet's proceed with creating the PDF report.",
