This could indicate bias that may need further investigation.\n\n- **HSIC Analysis:** The low HSIC value does not suggest a strong overall bias; however, the Chi-Square results take precedence due to their statistical significance.\n\n- **Wasserstein-2 Distance:** The `NaN` results indicate a need for further data validation or exploration. It might be useful to check data completeness or variability across categories.\n\nBased on the Chi-Square test results, there appears to be a significant association between personal status and sex with credit risk outcomes. Careful consideration should be given to these findings, especially in decision-making processes related to credit risk evaluation.\n\nI'll now generate a detailed detection report including these findings.",
