I'll start with the toolset methods and then generate and execute the code for the Wasserstein-2 distance.",

Here, the value is quite low, suggesting minimal association between \"Language\" and \"ScoreText\".\n\n2. **Elift Calculation**:\n   - **Max Elift**: 1.32\n   - **Interpretation**: Elift values greater than 1 indicate some level of association. The value of 1.32 suggests a weak correlation between the two categorical variables.\n\n3. **Wasserstein-2 Distance Calculation**:\n   - **Distance between English and Spanish**: 0.146\n   - **Interpretation**: The Wasserstein-2 distance provides a measure of how different the distribution of assessment scores is between English and Spanish speakers. The value of 0.146 indicates some distributional difference, but it is not considered extreme.\n\n### Summary of Findings\n\n- **Bias Type**: Correlation\n- **Relevant Features**: Language and ScoreText\n- **Bias Level**: Based on the results, the bias can be categorized as follows:\n  - **Cramér's V**: Minimal association, suggesting no notable bias.\n  - **Elift**: Weak correlation, indicating minimal bias.\n  - **Wasserstein-2**: Some distributional differences, but not extreme.\n\nOverall, the dataset shows minimal bias in terms of language influencing assessment scores. While there are slight variations in the distribution of scores between language groups, these are not substantial enough to be concerning.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- Given the minimal bias detected, the dataset can be used with some confidence. However, it is advisable to consider these findings in specific applications where language might influence outcomes.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.",

The results from the tools used indicate that the relevant metrics are close to the ideal state, and you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.\n\n### Recommendations\nWhile there is minimal bias detected, it's advisable to be aware of these findings in specific applications where language might influence outcomes. The dataset can be utilized with confidence, with slight attention in certain scenarios.\n\nYou can download the detailed detection report [here](sandbox:/mnt/data/generated_files/Bias_Detection_Report_COMPAS.pdf).\n\nIf you have any additional needs or other tasks to be done, please let me know!",
