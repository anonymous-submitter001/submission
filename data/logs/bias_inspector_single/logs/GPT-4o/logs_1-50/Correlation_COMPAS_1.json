The results from the tools I used indicate that the relevant metrics are very close to the ideal state. For instance, the Cramér's V value is 0.0857, which is below the threshold for notable bias. I believe you can confidently proceed with using this dataset.**\n\n### Visualization\n![Stacked Bar Chart](generated_files/stacked_bar_chart_gender_supervision.png)\n\nI will generate a detailed report summarizing these findings.",
