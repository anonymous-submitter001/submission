Your task is to assess whether the dataset shows a balanced distribution of employment duration or if certain durations are over-represented.

I'll extract the feature names from the CSV file to identify the \"employment duration\" column.",

Here's a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type**: Distribution\n2. **Relevant Feature**: Present employment since\n\n3. **Toolset Analysis**:\n   - **Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric**: \n     - Balance: 0.928\n     - Shannon Entropy: 2.155\n     - Interpretation: The balance metric suggests a close-to-balanced distribution with some slight skewness.\n   - **Max/Min Ratio**:\n     - Ratio: 5.468\n     - Interpretation: This value indicates a moderate level of bias where certain durations are more frequent than others.\n   - **Gini Index**:\n     - Adjusted Gini Index: 0.946\n     - Interpretation: A high adjusted Gini Index suggests minimal bias.\n   - **Relative Risk**:\n     - Normalized Bias Score: 5.468\n     - Interpretation: This score indicates that the distribution is moderately biased, with some categories being over-represented.\n\n4. **Reference Literature Method (Chi-Square Test)**:\n   - Chi-Square Statistic: 213.17\n   - P-value: 5.53e-45\n   - Interpretation: The Chi-Square test indicates a significant deviation from a uniform distribution, suggesting over-representation of certain durations.\n\n### Bias Level and Feedback\n\n**Overall Bias Level**: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)\n\n- **Feedback**: Based on my analysis, the feature \"Present employment since\" in this dataset shows a moderate level of bias. The tools I used suggest that there is some bias present. For example, the balance metric was 0.928, indicating a near-balanced distribution. The max/min ratio of 5.468 suggests moderate deviations, and the Chi-Square test confirmed significant deviations from a uniform distribution. While these results do not fully compromise the dataset’s usability, you may need to consider this bias in certain applications. I recommend giving these results additional thought before proceeding.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nI will now generate a detailed report summarizing these findings.",
