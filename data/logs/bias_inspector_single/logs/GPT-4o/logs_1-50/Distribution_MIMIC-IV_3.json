According to the balance thresholds, this corresponds to a Level 4 bias, which suggests a significant imbalance.\n\n2. **Max/Min Ratio**:\n   - **Ratio**: 657.0\n   - **Interpretation**: A max/min ratio of 657.0 is extremely high, indicating that one race is vastly overrepresented compared to others. This falls into Level 5 bias, reflecting extreme imbalance.\n\n3. **Gini Index**:\n   - **Corrected Gini Index**: 0.6257\n   - **Adjusted Gini Index**: 0.6480\n   - **Interpretation**: The adjusted Gini Index of 0.6480 suggests a significant level of inequality in the distribution of races, corresponding to Level 4 bias.\n\n4. **Relative Risk**:\n   - **Highest Relative Risk (White)**: 17.6253\n   - **Lowest Relative Risk (Hispanic/Latino - Mexican)**: 0.0268\n   - **Normalized Bias Score**: 657.0\n   - **Interpretation**: The high relative risk for the \"White\" category and the low for \"Hispanic/Latino - Mexican\" indicate a severe imbalance, leading to a Level 5 bias.\n\n5. **Visualization**:\n   - **Pie Chart**: Successfully created to visualize the race distribution. \n     ![Race Distribution Pie Chart](generated_files/race_distribution_pie_chart.png)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe analysis reveals that the distribution of patient races in the dataset exhibits significant to extreme bias. The highest levels of bias are observed in the max/min ratio and relative risk, indicating that certain races are vastly overrepresented compared to others.\n\n**Overall Bias Level**: Based on the results, the dataset shows a Level 5 (Extreme Bias) in the distribution of patient races.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further analysis, please let me know!
