Our task is to determine whether there is a dominant agency performing assessments or if the distribution of assessments across agencies is fairly even in the dataset located at `source_files/COMPAS.csv`. This is a distribution bias detection task focused on a single feature: the agency performing assessments.\n\nLet's proceed to create an overall plan for executing this task:\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Dataset Understanding and Preparation:**\n   - Load the dataset and identify the relevant feature for analysis, which is the \"agency\" or similar column that indicates which agency performed each assessment.\n\n2. **Bias Detection and Analysis:**\n   - Utilize various methods to analyze the distribution of assessments across agencies. We will focus on tools that can measure the distribution bias of categorical data, as this will allow us to determine if there is an even distribution or a dominant agency.\n   - Methods from the available toolset:\n     - **Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric**: This method helps in understanding the uncertainty and balance in the distribution of categories.\n     - **Max/Min Ratio**: This method provides insight into the proportion of the most frequent category relative to the least frequent one.\n     - **Gini Index**: This method measures inequality in the distribution.\n   - Additionally, I will review reference literature to find any relevant methods that might apply to this task, especially those with an ending digit greater than 5.\n\n3. **Visualization:**\n   - Create visualizations such as bar charts or pie charts to visually assess the distribution of assessments across different agencies.\n\n4. **Result Summarization:**\n   - Summarize the findings, categorizing the bias level and providing recommendations based on the analysis.\n\nLet's start by loading the dataset and identifying the feature names to ensure we select the correct column for analysis.",

The Chi-Square test confirmed a significant deviation from uniform distribution.\n\n#### Recommendations:\nGiven the significant bias, it may be necessary to investigate the reasons behind one agency's dominance in assessments. Consider strategies to balance the distribution if fairness in assessment distribution is a goal."
