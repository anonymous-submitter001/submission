This task involves understanding the distribution of a single categorical feature, hence it's a distribution bias analysis.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Dataset Understanding**: \n   - Load the dataset and extract the \"occupation\" feature for analysis.\n\n2. **Detection and Analysis Methods**: \n   - **Toolset Methods**:\n     - **Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric**: Calculate Shannon entropy to measure uncertainty and the balance metric to evaluate evenness in distribution.\n     - **Max/Min Ratio**: Calculate the max/min ratio of occupation categories to see if any occupation dominates.\n     - **Gini Index**: Determine the Gini Index to assess distribution inequality.\n     - **Relative Risk**: Analyze the relative risk to understand the prevalence of specific occupations.\n   \n3. **Visualization**:\n   - Use bar charts, pie charts, or treemaps to visualize the distribution of the \"occupation\" feature.\n\n4. **Reference Literature**:\n   - Retrieve and review relevant methods from the reference literature to ensure a comprehensive approach and select additional insights if available.\n\n5. **Result Summarization**:\n   - Summarize the findings in terms of bias type, relevant features, bias level, and provide a detailed explanation of the bias extent and related findings.\n\nI'll start by loading the dataset and extracting the \"occupation\" feature. Then I'll proceed with the detection methods.",

        "message_content": "COMPLETE TASK\n\nI have completed the analysis of the \"occupation\" feature from the dataset located at `source_files/Adult.csv`. Here is a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n### Summary of Findings\n\n- **Bias Type**: Distribution\n- **Relevant Feature**: `occupation`\n- **Bias Level**: Extreme Bias\n\n**Findings**:\n- The distribution of occupations in the dataset shows a very severe bias. The analysis indicates that certain occupations have a disproportionately high representation compared to others.\n- The Balance Metric (0.9001) and the Max/Min Ratio (460.0) highlight this dominance.\n- The Gini Index values (Corrected Gini Index: 0.9029, Adjusted Gini Index: 0.9673) suggest a high level of inequality in occupation distribution.\n- The Relative Risk analysis with a Normalized Bias Score of 460.0 supports these findings.\n\n**Visual Evidence**:\n- A bar chart was created to visually represent the distribution of occupations, which can be found in the generated report.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- Due to the extreme bias, I advise thoroughly considering its implications, especially in applications where equal representation is essential. Adjustments to the dataset may be necessary to address this imbalance.\n\nYou can download the detailed report [here](generated_files/occupation_bias_detection_report.pdf).\n\nIf you have any additional needs or other tasks, please let me know!",
