Here's a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n#### Bias Type\n- **Correlation**\n\n#### Relevant Features\n- **Race** and **Occupation**\n\n#### Bias Analysis Results:\n\n1. **Cramér's V**\n   - **Value:** 0.0808\n   - Interpretation: This value suggests a very weak association between \"race\" and \"occupation,\" indicating minimal bias.\n\n2. **Elift**\n   - **Max Elift:** 11.63\n   - Interpretation: This high value indicates a strong association between certain categories of \"race\" and \"occupation,\" suggesting a potential bias.\n\n3. **Statistical Parity**\n   - **Max Z-value:** 0.343\n   - Interpretation: The Z-value indicates a moderate level of disparity in proportions, suggesting some bias.\n\n4. **Chi-Square Test**\n   - **Chi-square statistic:** 850.87\n   - **p-value:** \\(1.61 \\times 10^{-142}\\)\n   - Interpretation: The p-value is extremely low, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. There is a statistically significant correlation between \"race\" and \"occupation.\"\n\n#### Bias Level\n- Based on the results from the methods used, the overall bias level can be categorized as **Level 5 (Extreme Bias)** due to the significant findings from the Elift and Chi-Square test, despite the low Cramér's V suggesting minimal association.\n\n#### Visualization\n- A stacked bar chart visualizing the distribution of \"occupation\" within each \"race\" category was created: ![Stacked Bar Chart](generated_files/stacked_bar_race_occupation.png)\n\n#### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, there is a strong indication of bias between \"race\" and \"occupation\" in the dataset, primarily driven by the strong associations captured by the Elift and Chi-Square test. These results suggest that certain occupations are more prevalent within specific racial groups, possibly reflecting systemic biases within the dataset.\n\n#### Recommendations\n- Consider these biases when using this dataset for analyses or modeling. It may be beneficial to further investigate the underlying causes and consider measures to address these biases in the analysis.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report.",
