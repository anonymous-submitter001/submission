We will be examining the age distribution of defendants in the dataset to determine whether it is evenly spread across all age groups or if certain age groups dominate.

Let's proceed with the following steps:\n\n### Overall Plan:\n1. **Dataset Understanding and Preprocessing:**\n   - Load the dataset and extract the \"Age\" feature for analysis.\n   - Clean any missing or invalid values from the \"Age\" column if necessary.\n\n2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**\n   - **Review Toolset:** Use tools like numerical distribution skewness, kurtosis, and quantile deviation to analyze the distribution of the \"Age\" feature.\n     - Skewness will help us understand if the data is symmetrically distributed.\n     - Kurtosis will provide insights into the tails of the distribution.\n     - Quantile deviation will help in assessing the middle spread of the data.\n   - **Reference Literature:** I will also review relevant literature to identify additional methods for analyzing numerical distribution bias.\n\n3. **Visualization Approaches:**\n   - Generate visualizations such as histograms or box plots to visually assess the distribution of the \"Age\" feature.\n\n4. **Result Summarization:**\n   - Summarize findings and categorize the bias level based on the results from the tools and literature review.\n\nLet's start by loading the dataset and extracting the \"Age\" feature.",

This suggests that the age data is not symmetrically distributed and has a tail on the left side.\n\n2. **Kurtosis Analysis**:\n   - Kurtosis Value: -1.0394\n   - Interpretation: A negative kurtosis indicates a flatter distribution with lighter tails compared to a normal distribution.\n\n3. **Quantile Deviation**:\n   - Quantile Deviation Value: 0.0845\n   - Interpretation: The quantile deviation is low, suggesting a relatively even spread around the median.\n\n4. **Max/Min Ratio from Literature**:\n   - Max/Min Ratio: Infinity\n   - Bias Level: Extreme Bias\n   - Interpretation: The min frequency is extremely low, indicating a very uneven distribution with one or more bins having very low data points.\n\n### Visualization and Recommendations:\n- To visually assess the age distribution, I recommend plotting a histogram or box plot of the \"Age\" feature. This will provide a clearer picture of the distribution and highlight any potential skewness or outliers.\n- Given the extreme bias identified, it's crucial to consider this when using the dataset for analysis, as it could impact the results. Adjustments or further preprocessing might be necessary to mitigate the effects.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe \"Age\" distribution in the dataset shows signs of \"Extreme Bias\" due to the very uneven distribution of data points across bins, as indicated by the infinite max/min ratio. The negative skewness and kurtosis further corroborate the non-normal distribution. This finding suggests that certain age groups dominate the dataset, and caution should be exercised when analyzing or interpreting results based on age.\n\nLet's proceed to generate visualizations and compile the report.",

Here's a detailed summary:\n\n#### Bias Type: Distribution\n- **Relevant Feature**: Age\n\n#### Findings:\n1. **Skewness Analysis**:\n   - The skewness value of -0.9023 indicates a left-skewed distribution.\n   - This suggests that the age data is not symmetrically distributed and has a tail on the left side.\n\n2. **Kurtosis Analysis**:\n   - The kurtosis value of -1.0394 indicates a flatter distribution with lighter tails compared to a normal distribution.\n\n3. **Quantile Deviation**:\n   - The quantile deviation is 0.0845, suggesting a relatively even spread around the median.\n\n4. **Max/Min Ratio from Literature**:\n   - The max/min ratio is infinite, indicating an extreme bias in the age distribution.\n   - This suggests that certain age groups dominate the dataset, with some bins having very low data points.\n\n#### Visualization:\n- A bar chart visualizing the age distribution has been created and saved as \"age_bar_chart.png\".\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe \"Age\" distribution in the dataset shows signs of \"Extreme Bias\" due to the very uneven distribution of data points across bins, as indicated by the infinite max/min ratio. The negative skewness and kurtosis further corroborate the non-normal distribution. This finding suggests that certain age groups dominate the dataset, and caution should be exercised when analyzing or interpreting results based on age.\n\nThe generated report, including the analysis and visualizations, is saved as \"COMPAS_age_distribution_report.pdf\".\n\nIf there are any additional needs or other tasks to be done, please let me know!",
