This chart helps to clearly illustrate the disparity in category representation.\n\n### Summary and Recommendations\n\n- **Bias Type:** Distribution\n- **Relevant Feature:** \"foreign worker\"\n- **Bias Level:** Extreme Bias\n- **Findings:**\n  - The \"foreign worker\" feature exhibits extreme bias, with significant inequality in the representation of different categories. The tools consistently indicate a severe imbalance, suggesting that foreign workers are either under-represented or over-represented.\n  - This substantial bias could imply that foreign workers have unequal access to credit, potentially impacting the fairness of credit assessments.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Data Usage:** Exercise caution when using this dataset for analyses involving \"foreign worker\" as it may lead to skewed conclusions due to the prominent bias.\n- **Further Investigation:** Consider exploring the reasons behind this disparity and potentially rebalancing the dataset to ensure fair representation.\n\nI will now generate a detailed report with these findings and visualizations.",
