It will allow us to understand the strength of the association between \"education\" and \"race.\"\n  - **Elift**: This method provides a ratio of confidence levels, helping us see if education levels have a preference for specific races or vice versa.\n  - **Statistical Parity and Z-scores**: This will enable us to examine if certain races have significantly different proportions in education levels.\n\n### Step 4: Visualization\n- **Stacked Bar Chart**: This will help visualize the distribution and relationship between \"education\" and \"race.\"\n\n### Step 5: References for Additional Insights\n- I will review the reference literature to see if there are any additional relevant methods we should incorporate.\n\n### Step 6: Summarization and Reporting\n- Summarize the findings based on the analysis results.\n- Generate a detailed report, including visualizations and recommendations.\n\nI will first load the dataset and extract the necessary features.

Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type**: Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features**: Education, Race\n\n#### Detection Results:\n- **Cramér's V**: 0.0749\n  - This value suggests a very weak association between \"education\" and \"race\".\n- **Max Elift**: 6.437\n  - Indicates a significant correlation, suggesting that certain education levels may have a strong preference for specific races or vice versa.\n- **Max Z-value from Statistical Parity**: 0.498\n  - This suggests a moderate level of difference in proportions of education levels across races.\n\n#### Bias Level Assessment:\n- **Cramér's V** indicates a minimal bias (Level 2).\n- **Elift** suggests an extreme bias (Level 5).\n- **Statistical Parity** shows a moderate bias (Level 3).\n\nOverall, the analysis reveals varying levels of bias across different metrics. The most concerning finding is from the Elift measure, which indicates a significant correlation between education and race.\n\n### Visualization:\nA stacked bar chart has been created to visually represent the distribution of education levels across different races. You can find the visualization here: ![Stacked Bar Chart](generated_files/education_race_stacked_bar_chart.png).\n\n### Feedback to User:\nBased on my analysis, there appears to be a significant correlation between \"education\" and \"race\" as indicated by the Elift measure. While Cramér's V suggests a minimal association, the Elift value points to a potential bias that could impact interpretations and applications of the data. I recommend careful consideration of these findings, particularly in contexts where racial equity is a concern. The dataset may require adjustments or additional analysis to mitigate this bias.\n\nI'll proceed to generate a detailed report based on these findings.",
