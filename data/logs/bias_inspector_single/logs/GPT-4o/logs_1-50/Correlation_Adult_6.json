Understanding the Dataset\n- **Extract Features**: We will focus on the \"occupation\" and \"income\" columns from the dataset.\n\n#### 2. Detection and Analysis Methods\nGiven that both \"occupation\" and \"income\" are categorical variables, we will use correlation bias analysis methods suitable for categorical-categorical relationships.\n\n- **Toolset Methods**:\n  - **Cramér's V**: Measures association between two categorical variables.\n  - **Elift**: Analyzes correlation by examining confidence in associations.\n  - **Statistical Parity & Z-scores**: Evaluates proportion differences between categories.\n  - **Lipschitz Function**: Assesses loss differences between distributions.\n  - **Total Variation Distance**: Measures distribution differences.\n\n- **Reference Literature**:\n  First, I will invoke the tool to retrieve all reference intentions to find relevant methods.\n\n### Visualization\n- **Stacked Bar Chart**: To visualize the distribution of income levels across different occupations.\n\n### Result Summarization\n- Summarize the results and categorize the bias level into one of the five tiers.\n\nLet's proceed to review the reference literature to potentially find additional methods for this analysis.",
