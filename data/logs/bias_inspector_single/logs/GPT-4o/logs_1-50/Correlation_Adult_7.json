You can download it here: [detection_report.pdf](generated_files/detection_report.pdf).\n\n### Summary of Findings\n\n- **Significant Bias Detected**: The analysis indicates a significant correlation bias between \"race\" and \"income\".\n- **Chi-Square Test**: Showed a strong association with a very low p-value, indicating a significant difference in income distribution across different racial groups.\n- **Wasserstein-2 Distance**: Highlighted notable distributional differences.\n- **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**: Resulted in a negative value, which may require further examination or adjustments.\n\n#### Recommendations\nDue to the significant bias detected, it's advisable to proceed with caution when using this dataset for analysis involving \"race\" and \"income\". Consider methods to adjust or address the bias as needed.\n\nIf you have any additional questions or need further assistance, please let me know!",
