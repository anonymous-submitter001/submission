Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric Analysis:**\n- Balance: 0.803\n- Shannon Entropy: 2.667\n- **Interpretation:** Indicates minimal bias with a fairly balanced and uncertain distribution.\n\n**2. Max/Min Ratio Analysis:**\n- Ratio: 31.111\n- **Interpretation:** Shows extreme bias, with significant disparity between the most and least frequent categories.\n\n**3. Entropy and Normalized Entropy Analysis:**\n- Entropy: 2.667\n- Normalized Entropy: 0.803\n- **Interpretation:** Moderate bias, indicating some unevenness in category distribution.\n\n**4. Gini Index Analysis:**\n- Adjusted Gini Index: 0.902\n- **Interpretation:** Minimal bias, suggesting relatively even distribution.\n\n**5. Relative Risk Analysis:**\n- Normalized Bias Score: 31.111\n- **Interpretation:** Extreme bias, highlighting significant differences in observed versus expected frequencies.\n\n**6. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:**\n- K-S Statistic: 0.987\n- P-Value: 0.0\n- **Interpretation:** Extreme bias, strong indication of deviation from expected distribution.\n\n### Visualizations:\n- Visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts could further illustrate the distribution biases observed.\n\n### Recommendations:\nGiven the results, the distribution of loan purposes is highly skewed, with certain purposes dominating the dataset. To address this bias, consider using re-sampling techniques or stratification to ensure a more balanced feature representation. This is crucial for analyses or models that rely on the 'Purpose' feature to prevent skewed results and ensure fair predictive performance.\n"
