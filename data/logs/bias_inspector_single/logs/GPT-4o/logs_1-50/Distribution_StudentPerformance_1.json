However, in practical terms, JSD values close to 0 suggest minimal deviation from the expected distribution.\n\n### Visualization Plan\nTo visualize the distribution of the `address` feature, I will create a pie chart to graphically represent the proportions of urban and rural students.\n\nNext, I'll proceed to generate this visualization.",

The dataset is reasonably balanced with only minimal attention needed in specific scenarios.\n- **Recommendations:** You can use this dataset confidently, but be aware of the slight imbalance in certain analyses or decisions.\n\nThe pie chart visualization has been saved at `generated_files/address_distribution_pie_chart.png` for your reference.\n\nNow, I will generate a detailed detection report.",
