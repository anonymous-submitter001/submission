Here's a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type**: Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features**: \n   - Categorical Feature: \"Ethnic_Code_Text\"\n   - Numerical Feature: \"DecileScore\"\n\n3. **Bias Levels and Findings**:\n\n   - **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)**: The HSIC value calculated is approximately \\(3.82 \\times 10^{-11}\\), indicating a very low correlation bias. This suggests no significant correlation between ethnicity and decile scores.\n   \n   - **Max Absolute Mean (N value)**: The maximum absolute mean is approximately 0.995, suggesting a moderate correlation bias. This analysis indicates that some ethnic groups might have slight variations in their mean decile scores.\n   \n   - **Standardized Difference**: The standardized difference for the first category is approximately 1.30, indicating a significant correlation bias. This result suggests that there are noticeable differences in decile scores among ethnic groups.\n   \n   - **Cohen's d**: The Cohen's d analysis was not applicable because the ethnic categories are more than two.\n\n4. **Visualization**: A box plot was generated to visualize the distribution of decile scores across different ethnic groups. This visualization provides insight into how decile scores vary among ethnicities.\n\n5. **Overall Bias Level**: Based on the tools and methods used, the overall bias level in the dataset is considered to be significant. The results suggest noticeable differences in decile scores among different ethnic groups, which could affect the fairness and reliability of the dataset.\n\n### Recommendations\nGiven these findings, I would advise a cautious assessment of the potential effects of this bias before using this dataset. You may want to consider addressing this bias through data adjustment or further investigation.\n\nLet's generate the detection report.",
