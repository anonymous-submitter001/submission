Although the dataset is usable, the presence of moderate bias should be taken into account in applications, especially where even representation across categories is critical.\n\n### Recommendations\nWhile the dataset is still usable, it is advisable to consider potential biases in insurance types when making broad inferences or decisions based on this data. Adjustments or awareness of these biases may be necessary to ensure fair and accurate analyses.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report.",
