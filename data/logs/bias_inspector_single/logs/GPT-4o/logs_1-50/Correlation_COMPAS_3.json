This involves examining whether certain ethnic groups are more likely to receive higher or lower recommended supervision levels.\n\nLet's outline the plan for this task:\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Dataset Understanding and Preprocessing:**\n   - Load the dataset and extract the relevant features: Ethnicity and Recommended Supervision Level.\n   - Clean the data if necessary to handle missing or invalid values.\n\n2. **Detection and Analysis Methods:**\n   - **Correlation Analysis**: Since both features are categorical, we will check for correlation using methods like Cramér's V and Elift from our toolset.\n   - **Reference Literature**: I will also review reference literature to identify any additional methods that may be applicable, focusing on references with an ending digit greater than 5.\n\n3. **Visualization:**\n   - Visualize the relationship between ethnicity and supervision levels using a stacked bar chart to provide a clear picture of the distribution across different groups.\n\n4. **Result Summarization:**\n   - Summarize the findings, clearly explaining the bias type, relevant features, and bias level. Provide recommendations based on the analysis.\n\nI will start by loading the dataset and extracting the necessary columns. Let's proceed with that.",
