According to the bias level classification from the reference:\n   - A ratio greater than 100 indicates \"Extreme Bias.\"\n   - A ratio greater than 10 indicates \"Significant Bias.\"\n   - Therefore, the age distribution in this dataset shows \"Significant Bias.\"\n\n2. **Shannon Entropy**: The calculated Shannon entropy for the age distribution is approximately 1.95, compared to the maximum possible entropy of 2.30.\n   - A significant drop from maximum entropy indicates potential bias.\n   - The entropy value suggests that the distribution is not uniform, supporting the finding of \"Significant Bias.\"\n\n### Visualization:\n- A bar chart depicting the age distribution has been generated to visually confirm the distribution patterns.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Bias Type**: Distribution\n- **Relevant Feature**: Age\n- **Bias Level**: Level 4 (Significant Bias)\n\n#### Detailed Feedback:\n- Based on the analysis, the age distribution in this dataset displays significant bias. The max-min ratio of approximately 91.99 indicates a prominent skew in the distribution, where certain age groups dominate. The Shannon entropy value further confirms this, as it is noticeably lower than the maximum entropy value, pointing to a lack of uniformity in the distribution. \n\nGiven these findings, it's advisable to consider this bias in your analysis and decision-making processes. You might need to adjust the dataset or apply techniques to mitigate the bias's effects if used in contexts where balanced age representation is crucial.\n\nLet's generate the detection report with these insights.",

This is evident from a max-min ratio of approximately 91.99, indicating skewness in the distribution. Additionally, the Shannon entropy value of 1.95, compared to the maximum possible entropy of 2.30, suggests a notable lack of uniformity.\n\nThese findings suggest that if balanced age representation is important for your analysis or application, you may need to adjust the dataset or apply correction techniques.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to let me know!",
