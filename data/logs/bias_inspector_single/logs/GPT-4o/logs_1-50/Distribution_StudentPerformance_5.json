Below is a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type:** Distribution\n2. **Relevant Feature(s):** famrel\n3. **Bias Level:**\n   - **Relative Risk Analysis:** The normalized bias score was found to be 24.375. This indicates significant variations in relative risk across categories.\n   - **Chi-Square Test:** The Chi-Square value was 150.18 with a p-value of approximately \\(1.87 \\times 10^{-31}\\), which is highly significant. This implies that the distribution of the \"famrel\" feature significantly deviates from a uniform distribution.\n\n4. **Feedback to User:**\n   - **Level 5 (Extreme Bias):** According to my analysis and the tool results, the \"famrel\" feature in this dataset shows a very severe bias. For example, the Chi-Square test calculated a value of 150.18 with a p-value indicating extreme significance, and the Relative Risk analysis shows a normalized bias score of 24.375. These values indicate extreme bias, which may significantly affect the dataset’s reliability. I strongly recommend thoroughly considering the implications of this bias, and you may need to adjust the dataset to mitigate these effects.\n\n5. **Additional Explanation:** The analysis shows that students report significantly different levels of family relationship quality, which suggests an uneven distribution. This could affect the interpretation of data where family relationship quality is a factor or outcome. The bar chart visualization supports these findings by showing the frequency distribution of each category.\n\n6. **Visualization:** A bar chart showing the distribution of \"famrel\" was created to visually support the analysis. The chart is saved as \"generated_files/famrel_bar_chart.png\".\n\nBased on the results, the overall bias level for the \"famrel\" feature is Level 5, indicating extreme bias. \n\nPlease let me know if there are any additional needs or further tasks you would like me to perform!",
