This will need to be addressed to complete the Chi-Square analysis.\n\n2. **Shannon Entropy and Balance Metric**:\n   - Balance: 0.7964\n   - This indicates a moderate level of balance in the income distribution. The bias is categorized at **Level 3** (Moderate Bias).\n\n3. **Max/Min Ratio Distribution Analysis**:\n   - Ratio: 3.15\n   - This ratio suggests a moderate imbalance in the income categories, indicating **Level 3** (Moderate Bias).\n\n4. **Gini Index**:\n   - Adjusted Gini Index: 0.7313\n   - A higher Gini index indicates significant inequality in income distribution, suggesting a **Level 3** (Moderate Bias).\n\n5. **Relative Risk**:\n   - Normalized Bias Score: 3.15\n   - The relative risk for income categories indicates a moderate risk bias, categorized as **Level 3** (Moderate Bias).\n\n6. **Visualization**:\n   - A pie chart was successfully created to visualize the income distribution: ![Income Distribution Pie Chart](generated_files/income_distribution_pie_chart.png)\n   - There was an error in creating the bar chart, which will need to be addressed separately.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Bias Type**: Distribution\n- **Relevant Feature**: Income\n- **Bias Level**: Based on the analyses, the income feature exhibits a **Moderate Bias** (Level 3).\n- The analyses show a moderate imbalance in income distribution, with significant inequality and moderate risk bias. The Shannon entropy and balance metrics also suggest that the distribution is not perfectly balanced.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- Consider further investigation into potential reasons for this moderate bias in income distribution.\n- Depending on the application, addressing this bias may be necessary to ensure fairness or accuracy in related analyses.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.",

This is evident from multiple analyses, including Shannon entropy, balance metrics, and relative risk. The Gini Index highlights significant inequality in income categories. These results suggest the distribution is not perfectly balanced, which may affect subsequent analyses depending on the dataset's application context.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Further investigation into the causes of this moderate bias is recommended.\n- Addressing this bias might be necessary for ensuring fairness or accuracy in analyses using this dataset.\n\nIf you have any additional tasks or need further assistance, please let me know!",
