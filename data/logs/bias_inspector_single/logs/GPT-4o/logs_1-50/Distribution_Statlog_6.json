The balance metric, max/min ratio, and normalized entropy all indicate that certain categories are over-represented. This may imply patterns in how creditworthiness is supported or evaluated, with potential implications for fairness and equity.\n\nConsidering the significant bias, it is advisable to carefully assess the potential effects before relying on this dataset for decision-making processes.\n\nI will now proceed to generate a detailed detection report.",
