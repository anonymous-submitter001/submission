Relevant Feature(s): ForeignWorker status and Credit risk\n3. Bias Level: \nThe results from the Chi-square test show a significant correlation between ForeignWorker status and Credit risk (p-value = 0.0158), indicating potential bias.\nThe results from the t-test show no significant difference in Credit amount between ForeignWorker status groups (t-statistic = nan, p-value = nan), which may indicate no bias or insufficient data.\nThe results from the causal Bayesian network analysis show an ACE value of nan, which may indicate no bias or insufficient data.\n\nOverall, the results suggest potential correlation bias between ForeignWorker status and Credit risk, but the evidence is not conclusive due to insufficient data or statistical issues.\n\nAdditional Explanation:\nThe correlation bias between ForeignWorker status and Credit risk may be due to various factors, such as differences in credit history, income, or employment status. However, the results from the t-test and causal Bayesian network analysis are inconclusive, suggesting that further analysis is needed to determine the extent of the bias.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK. \n\nThe overall bias level is Level 3. \n\nDo you have any other questions or tasks?",
