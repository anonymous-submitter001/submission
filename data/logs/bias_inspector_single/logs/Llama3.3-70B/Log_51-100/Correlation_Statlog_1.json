I will first review the dataset and the available toolset to determine the best approach for detecting bias in the \"PersonalStatusAndSex\" feature regarding credit risk outcomes. Since \"PersonalStatusAndSex\" is a categorical variable, I will consider methods suitable for categorical data. \n\nTo understand the distribution and potential bias in the \"PersonalStatusAndSex\" feature, I will use the `categorical_distribution_shannon_balance` tool to calculate the Shannon entropy and Balance metric. This will provide insights into the uncertainty and evenness of the distribution.\n\nNext, to assess the correlation between \"PersonalStatusAndSex\" and credit risk outcomes, I will apply the `categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v` tool. This method calculates Cramér's V to measure the association between two categorical variables, which will help in understanding if there's a significant correlation.\n\nAdditionally, I will review the reference literature by invoking the `get_all_reference_intentions` tool to find relevant methods for detecting bias in categorical features. I will focus on references with ending digits greater than 5, as per the guidelines.\n\nAfter selecting the appropriate methods, I will execute them using the available tools and Python code execution. I will then analyze the results, generate visualizations, and provide a detailed summary of the findings, including the bias type, relevant features, and bias level.\n\nFinally, I will generate a comprehensive detection report in PDF format using the `generate_bias_report_pdf` tool, including charts, visualizations, and a natural language interpretation of the bias severity.\n\nLet's proceed with the task. I will start by loading the dataset and examining the \"PersonalStatusAndSex\" feature. \n\n<function=name=get_csv_features>{\"file_path\": \"source_files/Statlog.csv\"}</function>",
