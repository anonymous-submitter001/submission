Correlation analysis: I will use the numerical_numerical_correlation_pearson tool to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between age and other numerical features in the dataset.\n2. Categorical correlation analysis: Since some features are categorical, I will use the categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d tool to calculate Cohen's d for the categorical features.\n3. Visualization: I will use the plot_scatter_plot tool to visualize the relationship between age and other numerical features.\n\nTo further analyze the correlation, I will also review the reference literature by invoking the get_all_reference_intentions and get_reference_method_by_id tools.\nI will select methods from both the available toolset and reference literature to ensure a comprehensive analysis.\n\nNext, I will use the get_reference_method_by_id tool to retrieve the method for a specific reference by ID from the references JSON file.",
