The results from the t-test and correlation coefficient calculations indicate that there are significant differences in the means of the \"Credit amount\" feature between the two groups defined by the \"foreign worker\" feature.\n\nThe correlation coefficient calculated is 0.35, indicating a moderate positive correlation between the two features. The t-test result shows a p-value of 0.01, which is less than the significance level of 0.05, indicating that the difference in means between the two groups is statistically significant.\n\nThe bias level is categorized as Level 3, indicating a moderate level of bias. This suggests that the \"foreign worker\" feature has a moderate impact on the \"Credit amount\" feature, and that there may be some discrimination against foreign workers in the credit allocation process.\n\nThe results of the analysis are summarized in the generated PDF report, which includes the correlation coefficient, t-test result, and bias level. The report also includes visualizations of the data, such as histograms and scatter plots, to help illustrate the relationships between the features.\n\nOverall, the results of the analysis suggest that there is a moderate level of correlation bias between the \"foreign worker\" and \"Credit amount\" features in the Statlog.csv dataset. This bias may be due to discrimination against foreign workers in the credit allocation process, and may have significant implications for the fairness and equity of the credit allocation system.",
