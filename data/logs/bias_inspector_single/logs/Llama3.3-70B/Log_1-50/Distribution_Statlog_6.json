        "message_content": "COMPLETE TASK. Based on the results from the tools used, the bias type is Correlation, and the relevant features are 'Other debtors / guarantors', 'Credit history', 'Credit amount', 'Duration in month'. The results indicate that there is a correlation bias between the 'Other debtors / guarantors' and 'Credit history' columns, between the 'Other debtors / guarantors' and 'Credit amount' columns, and between the 'Credit amount' and 'Duration in month' columns. The mutual information between the 'Credit amount' and 'Duration in month' columns is 2.5098293124233506, indicating a strong correlation bias. The Chi-square statistic between the 'Other debtors / guarantors' and 'Credit history' columns is 15.314876150221936, and the p-value is 0.05330441758456023, indicating a correlation bias. The t-statistic between the 'Other debtors / guarantors' and 'Credit amount' columns is -2.3770042694249964, and the p-value is 0.017651927927895543, indicating a correlation bias. The effect size between the 'Other debtors / guarantors' and 'Credit amount' columns is -0.33746540795530716, indicating a moderate correlation bias. Overall, the results suggest that there is a significant correlation bias between the 'Other debtors / guarantors' and 'Credit history' columns, between the 'Other debtors / guarantors' and 'Credit amount' columns, and between the 'Credit amount' and 'Duration in month' columns. \n\nThe bias level is Level 4. \n\nI recommend that the user carefully evaluate the results and consider the potential implications of the correlation bias on their analysis or decision-making process. Additionally, I recommend that the user consider using techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, or regularization to mitigate the effects of the correlation bias. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",
