Bias Type: Distribution\n2. Relevant Feature: patient_age\n3. Bias Level: Minimal Bias\n4. Additional Explanation: The age distribution shows minimal bias, with a slight deviation from symmetry and a max/min ratio of 2.51.\n5. Visualizations: I will include a histogram of the age distribution to visualize the skewness and a bar chart to show the frequency of each age bin.\n\nPlease wait while I generate the report.",
