Here's why:\n  - The distribution shows a notable overrepresentation of the \"WHITE\" category.\n  - The \"UNKNOWN\" category suggests potential issues with data collection or privacy concerns.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Data Collection**: Ensure improved race reporting and categorization during data collection. Consider training for staff to ensure accurate data entry.\n- **Data Usage**: Be cautious when using this dataset for race-related analysis or generalization, as the overrepresentation and unknown entries could skew results.\n- **Further Analysis**: Conduct supplementary analyses focusing on the impact of the race distribution on the analysis outcomes. You may also want to stratify analyses by race to see if results differ significantly across groups.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK.",
