The main features of interest from the dataset include:\n\n- `Ethnic_Code_Text`: This feature represents the ethnicity of the individuals.\n- `DecileScore`: This feature is a risk score ranging from 1 to 10, representing the recommended supervision level, where a higher score indicates a higher level of supervision risk.\n\nLet's proceed with analyzing the dataset to detect any potential biases in the supervision levels across different ethnic groups. We'll use statistical analysis and visualization tools to examine the relationships and biases.\n\nDECISION ANALYSIS\n\nI will now perform the analysis to assess the level of bias related to ethnicity in the recommended supervision levels.",

This level suggests that there is a considerable discrepancy in supervision levels recommended for different ethnic groups.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Further Investigation**: It's recommended to further explore the reasons behind the significant bias and consider factors such as historical, socio-economic, and systemic influences.\n- **Policy Reevaluation**: Agencies should reevaluate their policies and practices to ensure fairness and equity in the recommendation of supervision levels.\n- **Data Review**: Regular audits and reviews of data collection and analysis processes should be conducted to identify and mitigate biases.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK\n\nIf you need visualizations or more detailed statistical outputs, please let me know!",
