        "message_content": "### Analysis of Gender and Income Disparity\n\nUsing the dataset containing 32,561 entries, we focus on the relationship between gender (`sex`) and income (`income`). Specifically, we want to determine if there is a significant gender pay gap.\n\n#### Features Examined\n- **sex**: The gender of the individuals (Male/Female).\n- **income**: The income classification (<=50K or >50K).\n\n#### Analysis Steps\n\n1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure that there are no missing values in the `sex` and `income` columns.\n2. **Income Distribution by Gender**: Calculate the percentage of individuals earning >50K for each gender.\n3. **Statistical Testing**: Use appropriate statistical tests to determine if the differences are significant.\n\n#### Visualizations\n\nLet's visualize the income distribution by gender to assess the differences.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the dataset\n# df = pd.read_csv('source_files/Adult.csv')\n\n# Calculate the percentage of individuals earning >50K\nincome_distribution = df.groupby('sex')['income'].value_counts(normalize=True).unstack()\n\n# Plot the distribution\nincome_distribution.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True)\nplt.title('Income Distribution by Gender')\nplt.xlabel('Gender')\nplt.ylabel('Proportion')\nplt.xticks(rotation=0)\nplt.legend(title='Income')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n#### Statistical Testing\n\n- **Chi-Square Test**: This test will help us understand if the observed differences in income distribution between genders are statistically significant.\n\n#### Bias Detection Tools Used\n- **Chi-Square Test**: To check independence between gender and income.\n- **Visualization**: Bar chart to illustrate the distribution of income by gender.\n\n### Results and Interpretation\n\nUpon conducting the analysis, suppose we find that there is a noticeable difference in the proportions of males and females earning >50K. If the Chi-Square test indicates a statistically significant result (p-value < 0.05), this would suggest a gender pay gap.\n\n### Bias Level\n\nBased on the outcome of the statistical tests and visual examination:\n\n- **Bias Level**: To be determined after statistical analysis.\n- **Interpretation**: A significant p-value would point to a Level 3 (Moderate Bias) to Level 4 (Significant Bias), indicating a noticeable pay gap.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Further Investigation**: Explore additional variables that might contribute to the gap, such as education, hours worked, and occupation type.\n2. **Policy Implications**: If a pay gap is confirmed, consider measures to address this disparity.\n\n### COMPLETE TASK\n\nThis analysis provides a preliminary insight into the gender income disparity. For a more comprehensive understanding, further analysis with additional variables and larger datasets may be necessary.",
