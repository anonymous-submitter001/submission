Here's a brief overview of the dataset:\n\n- **Number of Rows**: 32,561\n- **Number of Columns**: 15\n\nThe key features of interest for analyzing the influence of educational attainment on income are:\n- `education`: This categorical feature represents the highest level of education completed, such as Bachelors, HS-grad, Masters, etc.\n- `education-num`: This numerical feature represents the number of years of education completed.\n- `income`: This is a binary feature indicating whether income is `<=50K` or `>50K`.\n\nTo analyze the influence of educational attainment on income, I'll examine the relationship between `education-num` and `income`. I'll also consider the distribution of income across different education levels represented by the `education` feature. \n\nI will proceed with the analysis to check for trends and biases using appropriate statistical and visualization tools.",

However, to better understand the influence of education on income, consider integrating additional variables that may affect income (e.g., occupation, industry).\n- The dataset can be used for preliminary analysis but should be complemented with more comprehensive data to account for other influential factors.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific visualizations regarding this analysis, feel free to ask!",
