This will help identify how many assessments are attributed to each agency.\n\nLet's proceed with the analysis.\nHere's a detailed analysis of the distribution of assessments across different agencies in your dataset:\n\n### Dataset Analyzed\n- **Total Records**: 60,843\n- **Relevant Feature**: `Agency_Text`, which identifies the agency responsible for each assessment.\n\n### Analysis Process\n1. **Frequency Analysis**: Count the number of assessments attributed to each agency.\n2. **Visualization**: Create a bar chart to visually represent the distribution of assessments among agencies.\n\n### Results\nThe frequency analysis yielded the following counts for each agency:\n\n- **PRETRIAL**: 44,574 assessments\n- **Probation**: 13,269 assessments\n- **Parole**: 3,000 assessments\n\n### Visualization\n![Agency Distribution](generated_files/agency_distribution.png)\n\n### Bias Detection and Interpretation\n- **Dominance**: The agency labeled \"PRETRIAL\" is significantly dominant, conducting approximately 73.3% of all assessments.\n- **Bias Level**: **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**, indicating that one agency is predominantly responsible for the majority of assessments.\n- **Visual Evidence**: The chart shows a clear disparity between the agencies, with \"PRETRIAL\" having more than triple the assessments compared to \"Probation\" and over ten times more than \"Parole.\"\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Further Investigation**: Determine if the dominance of \"PRETRIAL\" is justified by the nature of the cases or if adjustments are needed to ensure a more balanced distribution.\n- **Consider Context**: Review the context in which these agencies operate. If \"PRETRIAL\" naturally handles more cases due to jurisdiction or case type, the bias may be justified.\n- **Data Usage**: When utilizing this dataset, be aware of the potential influence of \"PRETRIAL\" bias on any analysis or conclusions drawn, especially if agency representation is a critical factor.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK",
