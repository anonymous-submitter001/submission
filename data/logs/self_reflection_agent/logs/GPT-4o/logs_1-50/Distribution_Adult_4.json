Next, I will analyze the \"marital-status\" column to determine the distribution of different marital statuses and identify if any are overrepresented.

To determine if any marital status is overrepresented, I will calculate the frequency distribution for each category.\n\nLet's start by calculating the distribution and examining the results.",

This could influence any analysis that doesn't account for this distribution, especially if marital status is a key factor in the analysis.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- If analyzing marital status in relation to other variables, consider normalizing or weighting the dataset to account for the overrepresentation.\n- Be cautious of drawing conclusions where marital status might affect the outcome, as the dataset is not evenly distributed across all categories.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK",
