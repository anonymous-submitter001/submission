This reflects a moderate bias towards English-speaking patients.\n  \n### Recommendations\n\n- **Further Data Collection**: Consider collecting more data on non-English speaking patients to balance the representation.\n- **Data Usage**: Be cautious when using the dataset for studies that require generalization across different language-speaking populations, as English speakers are overrepresented.\n- **Analysis Adjustments**: If possible, apply statistical methods to adjust for language bias in analyses where language may impact outcomes.\n\nThese insights should assist you in understanding the language representation in your dataset and guide your decisions on how to address any biases found.
