This association could be influenced by social, economic, or systemic factors.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. **Further Investigation**: Consider investigating the underlying causes of this association.\n2. **Data Usage**: Use this dataset with caution in contexts where race and education may impact decisions.\n3. **Mitigation Strategies**: If using this data for model training, ensure that you apply bias mitigation techniques to prevent models from inheriting or amplifying this bias.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK",
