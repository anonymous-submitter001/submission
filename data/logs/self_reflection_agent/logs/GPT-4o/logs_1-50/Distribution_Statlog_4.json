This indicates a moderate bias towards these durations.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Consider rebalancing the dataset if it is to be used for predictive modeling or decision-making processes to ensure that the model does not become biased towards over-represented durations.\n- If the bias is inherent to the population being studied, then it might be a reflection of real-world trends. However, the implications of this bias should still be considered in any analysis or model building.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK",
