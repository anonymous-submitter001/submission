This might include oversampling females, undersampling males, or using weighted classes.\n\n### Visualization\nWhile I can't generate visualizations directly here, I recommend plotting a bar chart to visualize this gender distribution effectively. This will provide a clearer picture of the imbalance.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional analysis, feel free to ask! \n\nCOMPLETE TASK",
