Use statistical measures and visualizations to assess and illustrate the extent of bias.\n\nLet's proceed with the analysis using these methods.\nTo assess the representation of students from urban and rural areas, let's first calculate the distribution of students based on the \"address\" feature.\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate Proportion\n- **Urban Students (U):** Determine the count and percentage of students from urban areas.\n- **Rural Students (R):** Determine the count and percentage of students from rural areas.\n\n#### Step 2: Visualization\n- Create a bar chart to visually represent the distribution of students based on their place of residence.\n\n#### Step 3: Statistical Analysis\n- Use a chi-square test to check if the distribution significantly deviates from an expected uniform distribution (i.e., equal numbers from both urban and rural areas).\n\nLet's carry out these steps:",

The chi-square test confirms that this distribution is statistically significant, suggesting a significant bias.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **For Analysis:** Consider weighting techniques or collecting additional data to balance the representation if aiming for generalizable conclusions.\n- **For Reporting:** Clearly disclose this bias if using the dataset for research or policy-making decisions.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK",
