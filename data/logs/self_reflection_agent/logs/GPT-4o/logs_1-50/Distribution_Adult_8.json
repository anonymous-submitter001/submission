This indicates a substantial bias in gender representation.\n- **Recommendations**: \n  - If gender balance is crucial for your analysis, consider collecting more data on the underrepresented gender or applying statistical techniques to adjust for the imbalance.\n  - Be cautious when drawing conclusions based on gender from this dataset, as the bias could skew the results.\n  - If possible, use this dataset in conjunction with others that may provide a more balanced view.\n\nIf you need further analysis or insights on other features, feel free to ask!
