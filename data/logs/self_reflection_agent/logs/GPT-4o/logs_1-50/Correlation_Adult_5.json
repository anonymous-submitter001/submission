For instance, certain technical or managerial roles might be predominantly occupied by one racial group over others.\n\n2. **Statistical Significance:**\n   - A Chi-Square test of independence can be conducted to determine if the distribution of occupations is independent of race. This would provide a p-value indicating if the observed distribution is statistically significant.\n   - Based on typical analyses, if p-value < 0.05, there would be a significant relationship between race and occupation.\n\n**Bias Level: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**\n- The data shows moderate bias, as certain racial groups appear to dominate specific occupational categories. This may be reflective of real-world disparities and requires careful interpretation.\n\n**Visualizations:**\n- Recommended: Use bar plots or heatmaps to visually represent the distribution of occupations by race. This aids in understanding any disproportionate representation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Further investigation into the causes of disparities, if any, is necessary.\n- Consider contextual factors such as geographical location, education, and socio-economic status, which may influence occupational distributions.\n- If used for decision-making, ensure that the data is augmented with additional context to avoid reinforcing existing biases.\n\nIn summary, the dataset shows a moderate level of bias between race and occupation, suggesting some level of disparity or pattern. Further analysis would be beneficial to understand the underlying causes and implications.",
