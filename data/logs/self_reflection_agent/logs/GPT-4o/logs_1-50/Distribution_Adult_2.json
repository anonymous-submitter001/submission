This is consistent with real-world employment patterns, where private employment is more common than government or self-employment.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- If \"Private\" is indeed significantly overrepresented, ensure that analyses account for this distribution, especially if comparing groups or making predictions based on workclass.\n- Consider balancing the dataset if using it for predictive modeling to avoid bias towards the majority class.\n\n**Bias Level: Level 2 (Minimal Bias)**\n- The distribution reflects real-world conditions, though Private employment may be overrepresented.\n\nIf you need further analysis or specific visualization, please let me know!",
