This will involve examining the distribution of values within this feature.\n\n#### Steps for Analysis:\n\n1. **Feature Examination**: Review the distribution of the \"Purpose\" feature to check for dominance by any single category.\n2. **Bias Detection**: Use statistical measures and visualizations to identify potential bias.\n3. **Visualization**: Create a bar plot to visualize the distribution of loan purposes.\n4. **Bias Level Categorization**: Classify the bias level based on the distribution and dominance.\n\nI'll start by calculating the distribution of the \"Purpose\" feature and then proceed to create a visualization.",

These two categories together constitute a significant portion of the dataset, suggesting a potential bias toward these purposes.\n- **Bias Level**: Based on the distribution, the bias level can be categorized as **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**. This level indicates a noticeable preference for certain loan purposes over others, but not to an extreme extent.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Dataset Utilization**: If the analysis aims to be generalized across various loan purposes, consider balancing the dataset by either oversampling underrepresented categories or undersampling dominant ones.\n- **Further Analysis**: If the focus is on understanding trends within the dominant categories, this distribution might actually be beneficial.\n\n### COMPLETE TASK\nThe analysis and interpretation of the bias in the loan purpose distribution are complete.
