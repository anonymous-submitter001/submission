Here's a comprehensive summary of the findings:\n\n### Analysis of \"hours-per-week\" Distribution\n\n#### Histogram Visualization\n- A histogram was plotted for the \"hours-per-week\" feature to visualize the distribution of work hours among the individuals in the dataset.\n- **Visualization Observations:**\n  - A significant concentration of individuals work exactly 40 hours per week, which is a common full-time working standard in many sectors.\n  - There are notable peaks at lower ranges such as 20 and 30 hours, indicating part-time work schedules.\n  - The distribution shows a right-skewed pattern, with fewer individuals working more than 40 hours per week.\n\n#### Statistical Measures\n- **Mean:** Approximately 40.44 hours\n- **Median:** 40 hours\n- **Mode:** 40 hours (most common work hours)\n- **Standard Deviation:** Approximately 12.35 hours\n\n### Bias Detection\n- **Concentration Bias:** The dataset shows a substantial bias towards individuals working 40 hours per week. This suggests that the dataset may not fully represent those who work irregular or non-standard hours.\n- **Skewness:** The right-skewed distribution indicates that while the majority work around 40 hours, there are still a significant number who work more than 40 hours, though less frequently.\n\n### Bias Level\n- **Bias Level:** Level 3 (Moderate Bias)\n  - The dataset exhibits moderate bias with a significant concentration around the 40-hour mark, which may affect analyses related to work hours if not addressed.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **For Analytical Use:** Consider the bias towards 40-hour work weeks when interpreting models or statistical analyses that use this feature, as it may not represent the true variability in work hours for all populations.\n- **For Data Collection:** If possible, ensure more diverse representation of work hours beyond the standard 40-hour work week to improve the dataset's applicability for broader analyses.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK",
