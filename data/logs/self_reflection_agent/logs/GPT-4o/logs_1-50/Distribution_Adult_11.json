I will calculate the distribution of these categories to assess balance.\n\n### Bias Detection Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the Proportion of Income Categories\n\n- Count the number of individuals earning `<=50K`.\n- Count the number of individuals earning `>50K`.\n- Calculate the percentage of individuals in each category.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Bias Level\n\n- Evaluate if one group significantly dominates the other based on the proportions calculated.\n\n#### Step 3: Provide Recommendations\n\nLet's compute the proportions now.",
