Let's take a closer look at these features.\n\n### Features Examined\n- **Workclass**: This feature indicates the type of employment or work arrangement of individuals, which can imply their economic role in the household.\n- **Marital Status**: This feature provides information about the marital state of individuals, which can suggest certain roles within a household setting.\n- **Relationship**: This feature directly describes the individual's role in the household (e.g., Husband, Wife, Unmarried).\n\n### Types of Bias Detected\nWe'll be examining potential biases related to:\n- Gender distribution in household roles.\n- Prevalence of certain roles over others based on employment type or marital status.\n\n### Tools and Methods\n- **Descriptive Statistics**: To get a general idea of the distribution.\n- **Visualization**: Creating bar charts to visually interpret the distribution of roles.\n\nLet's proceed with the analysis.",
