This is typical in datasets where the focus is on adult populations, like income studies.\n  \n- **Recommendation:** The dataset is fairly balanced for analysis, especially for studies focusing on adult populations. However, if analysis requires equal representation across all age cohorts, consider re-sampling or stratified sampling to address any slight dominance found.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further analysis or adjustments!",
