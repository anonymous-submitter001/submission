The differences, however, are not substantial.\n   - Standard deviations for grades are similar, indicating consistent performance variability within both groups.\n\n2. **Visualizations**:\n   - Box plots showed overlapping distributions for grades (G1, G2, G3) between both groups, suggesting no extreme differences.\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis**:\n   - The correlation between being in a romantic relationship and grades is weak, indicating that relationship status alone is not a significant predictor of academic performance.\n   - No strong correlations were found between romantic status and other behavioral variables like alcohol consumption or free time.\n\n4. **Bias Detection**:\n   - The dataset is balanced in terms of gender distribution and does not show extreme demographic biases that could skew results.\n   - There is a slightly higher proportion of urban students, but this does not significantly affect the overall relationship analysis.\n\n### Bias Level: \n\n- **Bias Level: Level 2 (Minimal Bias)**. The analysis indicates minimal bias related to demographic factors like gender and socio-economic status. The dataset appears to be fairly representative for analyzing the impact of romantic relationships on students' academic performance.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The dataset can be used for general insights into student performance and the influence of romantic relationships. However, the weak correlations suggest that additional factors should be considered for a more comprehensive understanding of academic performance drivers.\n- Future analyses could benefit from longitudinal data to capture changes over time and causal relationships.\n\n**COMPLETE TASK.**",
