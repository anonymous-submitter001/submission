Analyze the distribution of `marital_status` in the dataset.\n2. Investigate any correlation between `marital_status` and `hospital_expire_flag`.\n3. Use statistical tests to assess whether marital status has a significant effect on patient outcomes.\n4. Generate visualizations to illustrate any detected biases.\n\nLet's proceed with this analysis.",

This result suggests that marital status could impact care decisions, but it is not the sole determining factor.\n\n### Recommendations\n- **For Researchers and Practitioners:** Be mindful of potential biases introduced by marital status when interpreting patient outcomes. Consider adjusting models or decision-making frameworks to account for these biases.\n- **For Further Analysis:** Conduct more detailed studies to explore how marital status interacts with other demographic variables, such as age, gender, or race, to more accurately assess its impact on patient care.\n\nThis analysis concludes that while marital status can moderately influence patient care, it should be considered alongside other factors to avoid overemphasis on this single aspect.",
