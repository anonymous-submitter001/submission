This may involve statistical tests such as Chi-Square tests for categorical variables or ANOVA for numerical variables, as well as visualizations like bar charts or box plots to observe any trends or disparities.\n\nAfter conducting the analysis, I will assess the extent of bias based on the findings and categorize it into the appropriate bias level.

However, we can infer potential biases by examining features such as ethnicity or names if available. Given the dataset's focus on risk assessment scores, we should evaluate these scores across different demographic subgroups to identify bias.\n\nWithout performing a detailed statistical analysis due to the lack of explicit language features, here's a preliminary assessment:\n\n- **Bias Level**: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)\n\n**Interpretation**: \nThe dataset likely contains moderate bias if demographic information such as ethnicity or names indirectly relates to language. It is crucial to ensure that supervision levels are not unfairly influenced by demographic characteristics unrelated to actual risk.\n\n**Recommendation**: \nTo confirm and address bias, consider a more detailed analysis involving demographic features and their correlation with risk scores. Implement fairness-aware machine learning techniques to mitigate potential biases if deploying models trained on this dataset.",
