Descriptive Statistics\n- Calculate the mean and standard deviation of `G3` for Urban (`U`) and Rural (`R`) students.\n\n#### 2. Comparative Analysis\n- Conduct a T-test on the `G3` scores between Urban and Rural groups to determine if the difference is statistically significant.\n\n#### 3. Visualization\n- Plot a boxplot to visualize the distribution of the `G3` grades for Urban and Rural students.\n\nI will now proceed with these calculations and visualizations.",
