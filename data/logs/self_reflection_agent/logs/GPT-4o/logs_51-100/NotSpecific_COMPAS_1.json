It contains 60,843 records with 28 columns, including identifiers like `Person_ID`, `AssessmentID`, `Case_ID`, demographic information, and scores such as `DecileScore`, `ScoreText`, and `RawScore`.\n\n**Features Examined:**\nTo assess gender bias, we will focus on features that could reveal disparities between different gender groups. These features include:\n- `DecileScore`: A risk assessment score given in deciles.\n- `ScoreText`: A textual representation of risk (e.g., Low, Medium, High).\n- `RawScore`: The raw score used to calculate the decile.\n- `Gender`: This feature is crucial for assessing gender bias.\n\n**Types of Bias Detected:**\nWe will examine both statistical bias (difference in average scores between genders) and representation bias (disparities in the number of records for different genders). Additionally, we'll assess any significant differences in the outcomes (`ScoreText`) by gender.\n\n**Tools Used:**\n- Statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to compare means.\n- Visualization tools for distribution plots and disparity charts.\n- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Verify that the `Gender` column exists and contains appropriate data for analysis.\n2. Conduct statistical analyses to detect any significant differences in scores by gender.\n3. Generate visualizations to illustrate any disparities.\n4. Provide a natural language interpretation of the results, along with a bias level categorization and recommendations.\n\nLet's proceed with these analyses.",
