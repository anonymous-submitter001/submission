Here's a breakdown of the dataset, which appears to be related to the COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) system:\n\n### Dataset Overview\n- **Size**: 60,843 records\n- **Features**: 28 columns, including:\n  - `Person_ID`, `AssessmentID`, `Case_ID`: Identification features\n  - `Agency_Text`, `LastName`, `FirstName`: Personal and agency details\n  - `RawScore`, `DecileScore`, `ScoreText`: Scoring and risk assessment\n  - `AssessmentType`, `IsCompleted`, `IsDeleted`: Assessment metadata\n\n### Features to Examine for Bias\nTo assess potential bias, especially language-related bias, we will focus on the following features:\n- **ScoreText**: It reflects the risk level assigned (e.g., \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\").\n- **DecileScore**: A numerical risk score that may contain bias.\n- **Agency_Text**: The agency responsible for the assessment, which might have procedural differences.\n- **Demographic Information**: Although not explicitly stated in the columns listed above, demographic variables like race, gender, or age might be present and relevant for bias detection.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will proceed to analyze these features to detect potential biases using statistical tests and visualizations. This will include:\n- Evaluating the distribution of `ScoreText` and `DecileScore` across different demographic groups.\n- Checking for language-related bias in text fields such as `Agency_Text`.\n\n### Tools and Methods\nThe analysis will include:\n- **Statistical Methods**: Chi-square tests for categorical data, t-tests, or ANOVA for continuous data.\n- **Visualizations**: Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution and relationships.\n\nI will now conduct the analysis.
