This indicates that while there is some correlation between age and supervision recommendations, it is not extreme or significantly skewed in favor of one age group over others.\n\n### Visualizations:\n- Visualizations were created to depict the relationship between age and supervision levels, showing a moderate trend.\n\n### Interpretation and Recommendations:\n- **Interpretation**: The dataset shows a moderate bias concerning age, meaning there might be some influence of age on supervision recommendations. However, it is not strongly biased.\n- **Recommendations**: Use the dataset with caution, especially when making decisions that could be sensitive to age-related disparities. It may be beneficial to adjust the model or dataset to account for and mitigate this bias if used in critical decision-making processes.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK.",
