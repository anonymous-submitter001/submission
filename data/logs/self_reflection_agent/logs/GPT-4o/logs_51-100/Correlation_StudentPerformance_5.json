This suggests a bias, albeit not a major one. Based on these results:\n\n- **Bias Level**: Level 2 (Minimal Bias)\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The dataset indicates a minimal bias towards students with internet access achieving slightly better grades. This bias is statistically significant but not large enough to be considered substantial.\n- Consider controlling for other confounding variables such as parental education levels or additional resources when utilizing this dataset for decision-making.\n\n**COMPLETE TASK**",
