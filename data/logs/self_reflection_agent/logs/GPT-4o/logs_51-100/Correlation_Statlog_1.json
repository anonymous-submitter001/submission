This indicates that certain groups may face more unfavorable credit decisions compared to others.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Consider further investigation into the causes of these disparities.\n- Implement measures to ensure fairness in credit decision processes, possibly through reevaluating decision criteria or incorporating fairness constraints in models.\n\nThis analysis provides an overview of the bias level concerning personal status and sex within the dataset and recommendations for addressing it.",
