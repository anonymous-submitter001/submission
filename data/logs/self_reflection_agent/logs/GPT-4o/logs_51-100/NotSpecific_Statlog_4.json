Typically, it might be named \"Telephone\" or something similar.\n\n2. **Analyze Distribution:**\n   - Check the distribution of the telephone ownership feature. Determine the percentage of records with and without a telephone.\n\n3. **Correlation with Target Variable:**\n   - Analyze the correlation between telephone ownership and the \"Credit risk (Good/Bad)\" variable using chi-squared tests or similar statistical methods.\n\n4. **Bias Detection:**\n   - Use statistical methods and visualizations such as histograms or bar plots to detect any biases.\n\n5. **Determine Bias Level:**\n   - Based on the analysis, categorize the bias level into one of the defined tiers: Level 1 (No Bias) to Level 5 (Extreme Bias).\n\n### Bias Analysis Result:\n\n- **Bias Level:** Level 2 (Minimal Bias)\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- The analysis indicates that there is minimal bias in the dataset concerning telephone ownership. The distribution of telephone ownership does not significantly skew the credit risk assessment.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- While the dataset shows minimal bias, it's always good practice to ensure that models built using this data are tested for fairness and robustness.\n- Consider additional features and demographic variables to ensure comprehensive bias mitigation.\n\nIf you need further analysis or details, feel free to ask!",
