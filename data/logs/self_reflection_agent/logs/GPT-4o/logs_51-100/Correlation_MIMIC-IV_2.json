Here's a brief overview of the dataset:\n\n- **Dataset**: MIMIC-IV\n- **Number of Records**: 1081\n- **Number of Features**: 10\n\n**Features of Interest:**\n- `hospital_expire_flag`: Indicates mortality during hospitalization (0 = survived, 1 = expired).\n- `patient_gender`: Gender of the patient (M = Male, F = Female).\n\nI will now proceed to analyze the correlation between gender and mortality rates. This will involve calculating mortality rates for each gender and assessing whether there's a significant difference.\n\nLet's proceed with the analysis.\nTo analyze gender bias in mortality rates during hospitalization, I will:\n\n1. Calculate the mortality rate for each gender.\n2. Perform statistical tests to determine if there's a significant difference in mortality rates between genders.\n\nLet's start by calculating the mortality rates.",

This indicates a higher mortality rate among males compared to females in this dataset.\n\n2. **Statistical Significance**:\n   - The p-value of 0.034 is less than the commonly used significance level of 0.05, which suggests that the difference in mortality rates between genders is statistically significant.\n\n### Bias Level: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)\nBased on the analysis, there is a moderate-level bias in mortality rates between genders, with males having a higher mortality rate during hospitalization.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Further Analysis**: Investigate potential causes for this disparity, such as differences in the severity of conditions, comorbidities, or treatment protocols.\n- **Data Collection**: Ensure balanced data collection and consider other factors that might contribute to mortality rates.\n- **Policy Implications**: Review hospital practices to ensure that treatment is equitable across genders.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK.",
