The relevant features for analyzing the correlation between family size and student performance are:\n\n- `famsize`: This represents the family size, categorized as \"LE3\" for families less than or equal to 3 members, and \"GT3\" for families with more than 3 members.\n- `G1`, `G2`, `G3`: These columns represent the first, second, and final grades of students, which are indicators of student performance.\n\nNow, let's proceed to analyze the correlation between family size and student performance. \n\n**DECISION ANALYSIS** \n\nI will now calculate the correlation and use visualizations to better understand any potential biases or patterns.\n### Analyzing Correlation Between Family Size and Student Performance\n\n**Features Examined:**\n- Family Size (`famsize`)\n- Student Performance (`G1`, `G2`, `G3`)\n\n#### Step 1: Correlation Calculation\n\nI will calculate the correlation coefficient between family size and each of the grade columns (G1, G2, G3). This will help determine if there is any linear relationship between family size and student performance.\n\n#### Step 2: Data Visualization\n\nVisualizations such as scatter plots and box plots will be created to visually assess any potential patterns or biases in the data.\n\n#### Step 3: Bias Detection\n\nThe analysis will determine if there is a significant bias in the correlation that could influence the interpretation of the data. This will include examining whether family size is disproportionately associated with higher or lower student performance.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations and visualizations.",
