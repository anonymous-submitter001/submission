Chi-Squared Test\n\nThe Chi-squared test will be used to determine if there is a statistically significant association between patient race and hospital mortality rates. \n\n- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no association between race and mortality rates.\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is an association between race and mortality rates.\n\n#### 3.

This suggests that while there is some bias present, it is not extreme.\n\n#### Recommendations:\n- **Data Usage**: Be cautious when interpreting results related to mortality rates and race due to the detected bias.\n- **Further Analysis**: Consider additional covariates that may contribute to mortality rates to refine the understanding of bias.\n- **Policy Implications**: If used for policy-making or healthcare improvements, ensure that decisions account for the moderate bias level detected.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis should guide your understanding of the connection between patient race and hospital mortality rates, considering the bias present in the dataset.",
