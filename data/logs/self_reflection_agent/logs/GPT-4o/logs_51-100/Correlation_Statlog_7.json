Comparing these distributions to detect any bias.\n3. Visualizing the results to aid in interpretation.\n\nI will now proceed with these analyses.",

The difference is not substantial enough to indicate significant bias.\n\n7. **Recommendations**:\n   - The dataset does not exhibit significant bias against foreign workers in terms of credit risk. However, continuous monitoring and further analysis with larger or different datasets are recommended to ensure fairness.\n   - Consider exploring other socio-economic factors that may influence credit risk to provide a comprehensive understanding.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you need further analysis or have any questions!",
