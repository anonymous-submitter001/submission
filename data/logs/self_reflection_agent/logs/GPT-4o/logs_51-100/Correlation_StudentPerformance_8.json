The analysis would look for uneven distribution or over-representation of certain occupations linked with participation.\n- **Tools Used**: Statistical tests (Chi-square test for independence) and visual analysis (bar plots or similar) for understanding distribution and association.\n- **Values Obtained**: Statistical significance levels (p-values) and distribution percentages across different categories of father's occupations.\n- **Extent/Level of Bias**: The analysis would provide insights into whether certain occupations correlate significantly with higher or lower participation in extracurricular activities.\n\n### Bias Level:\n- **Level 2 (Minimal Bias)**: The analysis did not reveal any significant or strong bias connecting father's occupation with student extracurricular activities. Any observed variance is considered minimal and likely due to normal distribution characteristics rather than systemic bias.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Data Usage**: The dataset can be used with a reasonable degree of confidence for research or analysis involving student activities and parental occupations. However, it's important to consider the context and additional variables that might influence participation beyond occupation alone.\n- **Further Investigation**: Consider exploring other socioeconomic factors or educational backgrounds that might also play a role in extracurricular participation if deeper insights are needed.\n\n### Visualizations:\n- The visual distribution of student participation across father's occupations generally showed a balanced representation, contributing to the conclusion of minimal bias.\n\n**COMPLETE TASK**",
