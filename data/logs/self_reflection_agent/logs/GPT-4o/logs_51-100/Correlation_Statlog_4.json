Are there underlying factors not accounted for in the dataset?\n- **Data Collection**: Consider collecting additional data that might explain the differences in credit risk ratings.\n- **Model Adjustment**: If using this dataset for predictive modeling, consider techniques to mitigate bias, such as re-sampling methods, regularization, or including fairness constraints in your models.\n- **Policy Implications**: If these findings are used to inform policy, ensure that measures are taken to protect foreign workers from potential discrimination.\n\nThis moderate level of bias suggests that while foreign worker status does have a measurable impact on credit risk, it is essential to explore further and address the potential bias in decision-making processes.",
