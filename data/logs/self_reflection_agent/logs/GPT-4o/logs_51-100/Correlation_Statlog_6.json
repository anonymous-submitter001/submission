This indicates that while there might be slight variations in credit history across different job types, these differences are not substantial or indicative of systemic bias.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Data Usage**: You may use this dataset for general analysis, taking into account the minimal bias detected. However, always consider additional factors that might contribute to credit history differences.\n- **Further Analysis**: If more granular insights are needed, consider segmenting the data by additional demographic factors to uncover any hidden patterns.\n- **Caution**: While the bias is minimal, remain cautious of potential confounding variables that were not addressed in this analysis.\n\nFor any further exploration or adjustments to the analysis, feel free to reach out!",
