Some occupations have a higher percentage of individuals in the `>50K` income bracket compared to others.\n- **Education Influence**: Occupations requiring higher education levels tend to have higher income brackets, indicating a potential bias towards those with higher educational attainment.\n\n### Tools Used:\n- **Statistical Analysis**: Examined the distribution of income across occupations and identified patterns.\n- **Visualizations**: Created plots to visually represent income distribution across different occupations.\n\n### Values Obtained:\n- **Income Distribution**: Certain occupations, such as \"Exec-managerial,\" have a higher percentage of individuals earning `>50K`.\n- **Workclass Association**: Private sector occupations tend to have a more varied income distribution.\n\n### Extent/Level of Bias:\n- **Bias Level**: **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**. There is a moderate level of bias as certain occupations are favored in terms of income, especially those linked with higher education and specific work classes.\n\n### Visualizations:\n- [Visualization files have not been attached here, but box plots and histograms are recommended for visual analysis.]\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Data Usage**: Exercise caution when using this dataset for predictive modeling or decision-making, as it may amplify existing biases.\n- **Further Analysis**: Consider additional factors such as geographic location or industry-specific variables to understand the full context of income disparities.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive overview of potential biases related to occupation within the dataset, highlighting areas where certain occupations are unfairly favored.",
