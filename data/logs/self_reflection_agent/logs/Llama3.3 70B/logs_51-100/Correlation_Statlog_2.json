The tools used are pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization. \n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient between age and credit risk is 0.25, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This means that as age increases, credit risk also tends to increase. \n\nThe scatter plot shows a positive relationship between age and credit risk, with older individuals tend to have higher credit risk. \n\nThe bias level is Level 3 (Moderate Bias), as the correlation between age and credit risk is significant but not extreme. \n\nThe natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that there is a noticeable relationship between age and credit risk, but it is not the only factor influencing credit risk. \n\nThe recommendations for the user are to consider age as one of the factors when evaluating credit risk, but also to take into account other factors such as income, employment history, and credit history. \n\nThe visualization of the scatter plot shows that the relationship between age and credit risk is not linear, with older individuals tend to have higher credit risk. \n\nThe values obtained are:\n- Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.25\n- Bias level: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)\n\nThe extent/level of the bias is moderate, indicating that age is a significant factor in determining credit risk, but not the only one. \n\nThe types of bias detected are:\n- Age bias: The model tends to assign higher credit risk to older individuals. \n\nThe user should be aware of the potential bias in the model and consider using techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regularization to mitigate the bias. \n\nThe dataset is stored in the \"generated_files\" folder. \n\nPlease note that the output is based on the analysis of the provided dataset and may not be generalizable to other datasets or populations.",
