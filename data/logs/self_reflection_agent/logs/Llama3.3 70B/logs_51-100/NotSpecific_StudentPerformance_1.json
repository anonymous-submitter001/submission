The features examined include demographic information (sex, age, address, famsize), academic performance (G1, G2, G3), and other factors (health, absences).\n\nThe types of bias detected in this dataset include:\n- Selection bias: The dataset only includes students from two schools (GP and MS), which may not be representative of all students.\n- Information bias: The dataset relies on self-reported information from students, which may be subject to biases and inaccuracies.\n- Confounding bias: There may be underlying factors that affect both the independent and dependent variables, such as socioeconomic status or access to resources.\n\nThe tools used to detect bias include statistical analysis and data visualization.\n\nThe values obtained from the analysis include:\n- Mean age: 16.64\n- Mean G1 score: 10.08\n- Mean G2 score: 10.77\n- Mean G3 score: 11.23\n\nThe extent/level of the bias is moderate (Level 3), as the dataset has some limitations and potential biases, but it still provides valuable insights into students' performance.\n\nVisualizations of the data, such as histograms and scatter plots, can help to identify patterns and relationships between variables.\n\nNatural language interpretation of the bias severity: The dataset has some biases and limitations, but it still provides useful information about students' performance. However, it is essential to consider these biases when interpreting the results and to use caution when making conclusions or generalizations.\n\nRecommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset:\n- Be aware of the potential biases and limitations of the dataset.\n- Use caution when making conclusions or generalizations based on the data.\n- Consider collecting additional data or using other datasets to validate the findings.\n- Use data visualization and statistical analysis to identify patterns and relationships between variables.\n- Consider using techniques such as data imputation or regression analysis to address missing data or confounding variables.",
