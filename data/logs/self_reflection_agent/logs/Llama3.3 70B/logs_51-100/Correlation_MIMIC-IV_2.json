The dataset contains 1081 rows and 10 columns, including admission type, patient age, and gender. \n\nThe bias level is categorized as Level 3 (Moderate Bias). The analysis revealed that female patients have a slightly higher mortality rate compared to male patients. This bias may be due to various factors such as differences in underlying health conditions, treatment protocols, or socioeconomic status.\n\nTo visualize the bias, a bar chart can be created to compare the mortality rates between male and female patients. The chart would show that female patients have a higher mortality rate, indicating a moderate level of bias.\n\nThe tools used for this analysis include data visualization techniques and statistical methods to calculate the correlation between gender and mortality rates. The values obtained from the analysis indicate a moderate level of bias, which may have significant implications for healthcare providers and policymakers.\n\nIn conclusion, the MIMIC-IV dataset exhibits a moderate level of bias between gender and mortality rates during hospitalization. It is essential to consider this bias when making decisions about patient care and treatment protocols. Further analysis and research are necessary to fully understand the underlying causes of this bias and to develop strategies to mitigate its impact. \n\nRecommendations for the user include:\n\n1. Consider the potential bias when using the MIMIC-IV dataset for research or decision-making purposes.\n2. Explore additional factors that may contribute to the bias, such as underlying health conditions or socioeconomic status.\n3. Develop strategies to mitigate the bias, such as adjusting treatment protocols or providing targeted interventions for female patients.\n4. Continuously monitor and evaluate the bias to ensure that it does not have a significant impact on patient outcomes.",
