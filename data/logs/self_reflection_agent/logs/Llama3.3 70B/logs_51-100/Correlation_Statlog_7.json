The features examined include 'foreign_worker' and 'credit_history'. \n\nThe tools used for this analysis include the Pandas library for data manipulation and the 'load_csv_file' function for loading the dataset.\n\nThe values obtained show that there is a relationship between the 'foreign_worker' feature and the 'credit_history' feature. The 'foreign_worker' feature has a moderate correlation with the 'credit_history' feature, indicating that foreign workers tend to have worse credit histories.\n\nThe extent/level of the bias is moderate, which corresponds to a bias level of 3. This means that the dataset has some bias towards foreign workers having worse credit histories, but it is not extreme.\n\nThe natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that the dataset shows a noticeable tendency for foreign workers to have worse credit histories. However, this bias is not severe enough to be considered extreme.\n\nThe recommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset are to be aware of the potential bias towards foreign workers and to consider this when making decisions based on the data. It may also be helpful to collect additional data to further investigate this relationship and to consider ways to mitigate any potential bias. \n\nVisualization of the data could help to better understand the relationship between the 'foreign_worker' feature and the 'credit_history' feature. However, based on the analysis, it is clear that there is a moderate bias in the dataset towards foreign workers having worse credit histories.",
