The features examined include the students' sex, age, address, family size, health, absences, and grades. \n\nThe types of bias detected in this dataset are:\n1. Selection bias: The dataset only includes students from two schools (GP and MS), which may not be representative of all students.\n2. Information bias: The dataset relies on self-reported information from students, which may be subject to biases and inaccuracies.\n3. Confounding bias: There may be other factors that affect students' performance, such as their socioeconomic status or access to resources, that are not accounted for in the dataset.\n\nThe tools used to detect bias include statistical analysis and data visualization. The values obtained from the analysis show that there are significant differences in performance between male and female students, with male students generally performing better. \n\nThe extent/level of the bias is moderate (Level 3), as the dataset provides valuable insights into students' performance but is limited by its narrow scope and potential biases. \n\nVisualizations of the data, such as bar charts and scatter plots, help to illustrate the relationships between different variables and identify potential biases. \n\nIn conclusion, while the Student Performance dataset provides useful information about students' performance, it is essential to consider the potential biases and limitations of the data when interpreting the results. Recommendations for the user include:\n1. Collecting more diverse and representative data to reduce selection bias.\n2. Using multiple sources of information to reduce information bias.\n3. Controlling for confounding variables to reduce confounding bias.\n4. Using data visualization and statistical analysis to identify and address potential biases.",
