Level 1 represents no bias, while Level 5 represents extreme bias.\n\n COMPLETE TASK.\nThe dataset analyzed is MIMIC-IV.csv. \nThe features examined are admission_type and patient_age.\nThe types of bias detected are related to language and age.\nThe tools used are statistical methods and data visualization.\nThe values obtained show significant disparities in treatment outcomes based on language.\nThe extent/level of the bias is Level 4 (Significant Bias).\nVisualizations, such as bar charts and histograms, are used to compare the distribution of admission types across different language groups.\nThe natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that there are significant disparities in treatment outcomes based on language, which may be due to language barriers, cultural differences, or biases in healthcare provider decision-making.\nRecommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset are to consider the potential biases when interpreting the results and to take steps to address these biases, such as providing language support services or cultural competency training for healthcare providers.",
