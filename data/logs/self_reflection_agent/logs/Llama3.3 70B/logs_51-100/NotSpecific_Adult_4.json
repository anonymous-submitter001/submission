The visualization shows that the majority of high-income individuals are white males. \nMy natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that there is a significant bias in the dataset, which may be due to historical or systemic discrimination. \nRecommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset include being aware of the potential bias and taking steps to mitigate it, such as data preprocessing and feature engineering. \n\n COMPLETE TASK.",
