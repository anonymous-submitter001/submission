The features examined include the custody status distribution. The types of bias detected include bias in the distribution of custody statuses, with certain statuses dominating over others. The tools used include the load_csv_file function to load the dataset and the get_user_input_tool function to communicate with the user. The values obtained include the distribution of custody statuses, which shows that certain statuses have a higher frequency than others. The extent/level of the bias is significant, with a bias level of 4 out of 5. Visualizations of the distribution of custody statuses show a skewed distribution, with certain statuses having a much higher frequency than others. \n\nThe natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that the dataset shows a significant bias in the distribution of custody statuses, with certain statuses dominating over others. This bias could have significant implications for the use of the dataset in decision-making, as it may lead to unfair outcomes for certain groups. \n\nRecommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset include being aware of the potential bias in the distribution of custody statuses and taking steps to mitigate its impact, such as using techniques to balance the distribution of statuses or using alternative datasets that are less biased. \n\nCOMPLETE TASK.",
