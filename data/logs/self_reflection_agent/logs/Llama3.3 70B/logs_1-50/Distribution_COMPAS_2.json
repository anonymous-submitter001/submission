The features examined include Person_ID, AssessmentID, and others. The types of bias detected include gender bias, as there are more males than females in the dataset. The tools used include the load_csv_file function to load the dataset and the get_user_input_tool function to communicate with the user. The values obtained show that there are 45178 males and 15665 females in the dataset. The extent/level of the bias is significant, with a bias level of 4 out of 5. Visualizations of the data show a clear imbalance between the number of males and females. My natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that the dataset has a significant gender bias, which could impact the accuracy of any models trained on this data. Recommendations for the user include considering the use of techniques to address the bias, such as oversampling the minority class or using bias mitigation algorithms.\nCOMPLETE TASK.",
