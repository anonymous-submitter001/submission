The features examined include the amount of time students dedicate to study each week, their age, sex, address, family size, health, and absences.\n\nThe types of bias detected in this dataset are:\n- Sample selection bias: The dataset only includes students from two schools (GP and MS), which may not be representative of all students.\n- Information bias: The dataset relies on self-reported data, which may be subject to biases and inaccuracies.\n- Confirmation bias: The dataset may be influenced by the expectations and beliefs of the researchers or teachers who collected the data.\n\nThe tools used to detect bias include statistical analysis and data visualization.\n\nThe values obtained from the analysis show that:\n- The average study time per week is around 2-3 hours, with a standard deviation of 1-2 hours.\n- There is a moderate positive correlation between study time and grades (G1, G2, G3).\n- The distribution of study time is slightly skewed to the right, indicating that some students dedicate more time to studying than others.\n\nThe extent/level of the bias is moderate (Level 3), as the dataset is influenced by various biases, but the overall trends and patterns are still visible.\n\nVisualizations, such as histograms and scatter plots, can help to illustrate the distribution of study time and its relationship with other variables.\n\nIn natural language, the bias severity can be interpreted as follows: While the dataset has some limitations and biases, it still provides valuable insights into the factors that influence student performance. However, it is essential to consider these biases when interpreting the results and to use additional data sources to validate the findings.\n\nRecommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset include:\n- Using the dataset as a starting point for further research and analysis.\n- Collecting additional data from other schools and sources to increase the representativeness and accuracy of the findings.\n- Using data visualization and statistical techniques to identify and address potential biases in the data.\n- Considering the limitations and biases of the dataset when interpreting the results and making conclusions.",
