The 'get_user_input_tool' function will be used to communicate with the user and gather more information if needed. \n\nAfter analyzing the dataset, I will categorize the bias level into one of the five tiers: Level 1 (No Bias), Level 2 (Minimal Bias), Level 3 (Moderate Bias), Level 4 (Significant Bias), or Level 5 (Extreme Bias). I will provide the user with comprehensive feedback, including the dataset analyzed, features examined, types of bias detected, tools used, values obtained, extent/level of bias, visualizations, and my natural language interpretation of the bias severity. \n\nBased on the analysis, I will also provide recommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset.
