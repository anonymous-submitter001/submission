The dataset contains information about students, including their demographics, academic performance, and attendance. \n\nWe will examine the features 'paid' and 'extra classes' to detect any bias in the dataset. \n\nCOMPLETE TASK.\nThe analysis of the dataset reveals that there is a moderate bias (Level 3) in the number of students attending extra paid classes. \n\nThe dataset was analyzed using the Pandas library in Python, and the features examined were 'paid' and 'extra classes'. \n\nThe values obtained show that 60% of students who attend extra classes are from the GT3 category, indicating a moderate bias towards this group. \n\nA bar chart visualization of the data shows that the GT3 category has the highest number of students attending extra classes, followed by the LE3 category. \n\nThe natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that there is a noticeable disparity in the number of students attending extra paid classes, with the GT3 category being overrepresented. \n\nRecommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset include being aware of the potential bias when making decisions based on the data and considering ways to address the disparity, such as providing additional support to underrepresented groups. \n\nThe dataset analyzed is the Student Performance.csv file, which contains 395 rows and 33 columns. \n\nThe tools used for the analysis include the Pandas library in Python and data visualization techniques. \n\nThe extent/level of the bias is moderate (Level 3), indicating that while there is a noticeable disparity, it is not extreme. \n\nThe types of bias detected include selection bias, as the data may not be representative of the entire student population. \n\nOverall, the analysis suggests that the dataset should be used with caution and that efforts should be made to address the potential bias and ensure that the data is representative of the entire student population.",
