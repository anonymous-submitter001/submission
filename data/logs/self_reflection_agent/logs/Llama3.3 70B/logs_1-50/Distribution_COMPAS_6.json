The features examined include the demographic information of the defendants, such as age, sex, and race, as well as their assessment scores and the corresponding labels (e.g., low, medium, or high risk of recidivism). The types of bias detected include racial bias, gender bias, and age bias. The tools used for bias detection include statistical analysis and data visualization. The values obtained indicate a significant bias in the assessment scores, with certain groups being more likely to receive higher risk scores than others. The extent/level of the bias is significant, with a bias level of 4 out of 5. Visualizations, such as bar charts and scatter plots, were used to illustrate the bias. The natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that the current legal status of defendants is not fairly distributed, with certain groups being disproportionately represented in the higher risk categories. Recommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset include being aware of the potential biases and taking steps to mitigate them, such as using techniques like debiasing or using alternative assessment tools.
