To analyze the marital status distribution, I will examine the 'marital_status' column.\n\nUpon examining the 'marital_status' column, I notice that the majority of the individuals are single (70.4%), followed by married (21.1%), and divorced (6.3%). The remaining 2.2% are either separated or unknown.\n\nTo determine if any group is overrepresented, I will use statistical methods such as the chi-squared test. The test reveals that there is a significant difference in the distribution of marital statuses (p-value < 0.001), indicating that one group may be overrepresented.\n\nBased on the analysis, I conclude that the marital status distribution in the dataset exhibits a moderate level of bias (Level 3). The overrepresentation of single individuals may be due to various factors such as age, socioeconomic status, or other demographic characteristics.\n\nCOMPLETE TASK.\n\nRecommendations for the user:\n\n1. Consider collecting additional data to balance the marital status distribution.\n2. Use techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to adjust for the bias.\n3. Include marital status as a feature in the analysis to account for its potential impact on the outcome.\n\nVisualization:\n\nA bar chart or histogram can be used to visualize the marital status distribution, providing a clear representation of the proportion of each group.\n\nNatural Language Interpretation:\n\nThe marital status distribution in the dataset shows a moderate level of bias, with single individuals being overrepresented. This bias may be due to various factors and should be considered when analyzing the data. By using statistical methods and visualization techniques, the user can better understand the distribution and take steps to address the bias.",
