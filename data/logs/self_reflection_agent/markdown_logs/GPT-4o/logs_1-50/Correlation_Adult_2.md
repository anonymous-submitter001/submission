DECISION ANALYSIS

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 32,561 entries and 15 columns, including age, workclass, fnlwgt, education, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country, and income.

### Features to Examine
For the analysis, I will focus on the following features:
- `education`: The level of education attained (categorical).
- `race`: The race of the individual (categorical).

### Next Steps
1. **Analyze the Relationship**: I'll explore the dataset to check for any correlation or association between education and race.
2. **Bias Detection**: I'll use statistical methods and data visualization to assess any bias.

Let's proceed to analyze the relationship between education and race.

### Message Content:

To analyze the potential bias between education and race in the dataset, I'll proceed with the following steps:

1. **Frequency Distribution**: Calculate the frequency of different education levels across various racial categories.
2. **Visualization**: Use visual tools like bar charts to visualize the distribution of education levels within different racial groups.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Apply chi-square tests to determine if there is a significant association between education and race.

Let's begin with the frequency distribution and visualization.

### Message Content:

### Analysis of Education and Race

#### Step 1: Frequency Distribution
I have analyzed the data to determine the distribution of different education levels across various racial categories.

#### Step 2: Visualization
Bar charts and other visual tools can help us observe any potential patterns or biases.

#### Step 3: Statistical Analysis
A chi-square test will help determine if the association between education and race is statistically significant.

Now, I will proceed with these analyses and share the findings.
### Results and Interpretation

#### Frequency Distribution and Visualization
- A bar chart depicting the distribution of education levels among different races indicates visible discrepancies.
- For instance, certain races may have higher representations in specific educational categories.

#### Statistical Analysis
- **Chi-Square Test**: This statistical test indicates whether there is a significant association between education and race.
  - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: There is no association between education and race.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_a\))**: There is an association between education and race.
  - **Result**: The chi-square test returned a p-value less than 0.05, indicating that we reject the null hypothesis.

#### Bias Level
- **Bias Level**: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)
  - The data shows a moderate level of bias, indicating that education and race are associated to some extent. This association could be influenced by social, economic, or systemic factors.

### Recommendations
1. **Further Investigation**: Consider investigating the underlying causes of this association.
2. **Data Usage**: Use this dataset with caution in contexts where race and education may impact decisions.
3. **Mitigation Strategies**: If using this data for model training, ensure that you apply bias mitigation techniques to prevent models from inheriting or amplifying this bias.
