DECISION ANALYSIS

I've successfully loaded the dataset. Next, I will analyze the "marital-status" column to determine the distribution of different marital statuses and identify if any are overrepresented. This will involve calculating the frequency and percentage of each category within the dataset. Let's proceed with this analysis.
The dataset contains the following unique marital statuses: Never-married, Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Married-spouse-absent, Separated, Married-AF-spouse, and Widowed. To determine if any marital status is overrepresented, I will calculate the frequency distribution for each category.

Let's start by calculating the distribution and examining the results.

Here's the distribution of marital statuses from the dataset:

| Marital Status          | Count  | Percentage (%) |
|-------------------------|--------|----------------|
| Married-civ-spouse      | 14976  | 46.0           |
| Never-married           | 10683  | 32.8           |
| Divorced                | 4443   | 13.6           |
| Separated               | 1025   | 3.2            |
| Widowed                 | 993    | 3.0            |
| Married-spouse-absent   | 418    | 1.3            |
| Married-AF-spouse       | 23     | 0.1            |

From this distribution:

- **Married-civ-spouse** is the most common marital status, representing 46% of the dataset.
- **Never-married** is the second most common, accounting for 32.8%.
- Other categories like **Divorced**, **Separated**, **Widowed**, and **Married-spouse-absent** have significantly lower representations, with percentages ranging from 1.3% to 13.6%.
- **Married-AF-spouse** is the least common, at only 0.1%.

**Bias Level:**
- **Level 3 (Moderate Bias):** The dataset shows a moderate bias towards individuals who are "Married-civ-spouse" and "Never-married", as these two categories make up the majority of the dataset. This could influence any analysis that doesn't account for this distribution, especially if marital status is a key factor in the analysis.

**Recommendations:**
- If analyzing marital status in relation to other variables, consider normalizing or weighting the dataset to account for the overrepresentation.
- Be cautious of drawing conclusions where marital status might affect the outcome, as the dataset is not evenly distributed across all categories.
