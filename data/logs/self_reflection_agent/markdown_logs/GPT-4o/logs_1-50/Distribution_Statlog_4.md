DECISION ANALYSIS

I have successfully loaded the dataset. Now, I will analyze the "Duration in month" feature to determine if there is any bias in the distribution of employment durations. This will involve examining the frequency of different durations and visualizing the distribution to identify any over-represented or under-represented durations.

Let's proceed with this analysis.

### Message Content:

To provide an accurate bias level assessment for the "Duration in month" feature, I will first analyze its distribution. Let's proceed with examining the dataset to determine the bias level.
To assess the distribution of the "Duration in month" feature and determine if any durations are over-represented, I will perform the following steps:

1. **Analyze the Frequency Distribution:** Calculate the frequency of each unique duration in months.
2. **Visualize the Distribution:** Create a histogram or bar chart to visually represent the distribution.
3. **Determine Bias Level:** Based on the analysis, determine if the distribution is balanced or if certain durations are over-represented.

Let's start by analyzing the frequency distribution of the "Duration in month" feature.

### Message Content:

Here is a summary of the analysis of the "Duration in month" feature from the dataset:

### Dataset Analyzed
- **File Path:** `source_files/Statlog.csv`
- **Total Records:** 1000

### Features Examined
- **Feature:** `Duration in month`

### Analysis Summary
- Calculated the frequency of each unique duration in months.
  
### Visualization
- A histogram was used to visualize the distribution of employment duration.

### Bias Detected
- Certain durations, such as 12 months and 24 months, were found to be over-represented.

### Bias Level
- **Bias Level:** Level 3 (Moderate Bias)

### Interpretation
- The distribution of employment durations is not uniform, with certain durations occurring more frequently than others. This indicates a moderate bias towards these durations.

### Recommendations
- Consider rebalancing the dataset if it is to be used for predictive modeling or decision-making processes to ensure that the model does not become biased towards over-represented durations.
- If the bias is inherent to the population being studied, then it might be a reflection of real-world trends. However, the implications of this bias should still be considered in any analysis or model building.
