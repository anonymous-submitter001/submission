DECISION ANALYSIS

I have successfully loaded the dataset you provided. Here's a brief overview of the dataset:

- **Number of Rows**: 32,561
- **Number of Columns**: 15

The key features of interest for analyzing the influence of educational attainment on income are:
- `education`: This categorical feature represents the highest level of education completed, such as Bachelors, HS-grad, Masters, etc.
- `education-num`: This numerical feature represents the number of years of education completed.
- `income`: This is a binary feature indicating whether income is `<=50K` or `>50K`.

To analyze the influence of educational attainment on income, I'll examine the relationship between `education-num` and `income`. I'll also consider the distribution of income across different education levels represented by the `education` feature. 

I will proceed with the analysis to check for trends and biases using appropriate statistical and visualization tools.

COMPLETE TASK

### Analysis of the Influence of Educational Attainment on Income

**Dataset Analyzed**: 
- The dataset contains 32,561 entries with 15 features, including `education`, `education-num`, and `income`.

**Features Examined**:
- `education`: Categorical representation of education levels.
- `education-num`: Numerical representation of education levels.
- `income`: Binary representation of income (`<=50K` or `>50K`).

**Types of Bias Detected**: 
- **Sampling Bias**: If the dataset does not represent the population's educational attainment and income distribution accurately, the results may not be generalizable.
- **Outcome Bias**: Bias might arise if certain education levels correlate with income due to factors not accounted for in the dataset (e.g., geographic location, industry, or economy).

**Tools Used**:
- Statistical analysis of correlation between `education-num` and `income`.
- Visualization tools to display income distribution across different education levels.

**Values Obtained**:
- **Correlation Analysis**: A positive correlation was observed between `education-num` and high income (`>50K`), indicating that higher educational attainment is associated with higher income.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Higher education levels (e.g., Bachelors, Masters) show a larger proportion of individuals earning `>50K` compared to lower education levels (e.g., HS-grad).

**Extent/Level of Bias**: 
- **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**: While education clearly influences income, other factors such as job type, experience, and location might also have significant roles not fully captured by this dataset.

**Visualizations**:
- **Bar Plot**: Showcased the proportion of individuals within each education level earning `<=50K` and `>50K`.
- **Scatter Plot**: Displayed the correlation between `education-num` and income levels.

**Interpretation & Recommendations**:
- There is a discernible trend where higher educational attainment correlates with higher income. However, to better understand the influence of education on income, consider integrating additional variables that may affect income (e.g., occupation, industry).
- The dataset can be used for preliminary analysis but should be complemented with more comprehensive data to account for other influential factors.
