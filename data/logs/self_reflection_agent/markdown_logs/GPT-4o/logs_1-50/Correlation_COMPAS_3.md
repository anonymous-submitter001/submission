### Message Content:

To address the inquiry about how ethnicity relates to recommended supervision levels in the COMPAS dataset, we will analyze the relevant features. The main features of interest from the dataset include:

- `Ethnic_Code_Text`: This feature represents the ethnicity of the individuals.
- `DecileScore`: This feature is a risk score ranging from 1 to 10, representing the recommended supervision level, where a higher score indicates a higher level of supervision risk.

Let's proceed with analyzing the dataset to detect any potential biases in the supervision levels across different ethnic groups. We'll use statistical analysis and visualization tools to examine the relationships and biases.

DECISION ANALYSIS

I will now perform the analysis to assess the level of bias related to ethnicity in the recommended supervision levels.

### Message Content:

Thank you for specifying the features. To proceed, I will analyze the relationship between `Ethnic_Code_Text` and `RecSupervisionLevelText` to detect any potential biases in the supervision levels across different ethnic groups.

DECISION ANALYSIS

Let's perform the analysis to assess the level of bias related to ethnicity in the recommended supervision levels.
To analyze the potential bias in supervision levels across different ethnic groups, I'll conduct the following analyses:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate the distribution of supervision levels for each ethnic group.
2. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to illustrate the distribution of supervision levels across different ethnic groups.
3. **Chi-Square Test**: Perform a statistical test to evaluate if there's a significant association between ethnicity and recommended supervision levels.

Let's proceed with these analyses.

### Descriptive Statistics
I'll first summarize the distribution of `RecSupervisionLevelText` for each `Ethnic_Code_Text`.

### Visualization
I will create visualizations such as bar plots to show the distribution of recommended supervision levels across different ethnic groups.

### Chi-Square Test
I will perform a Chi-Square test to statistically assess the association between ethnicity and recommended supervision levels.

Let's execute these analyses to determine the level of bias.

### Message Content:

Upon analyzing the dataset, I have determined the following:

### Descriptive Statistics
- **Distribution of Recommended Supervision Levels by Ethnicity**:
  - The dataset shows a varied distribution of supervision levels across different ethnic groups.

### Visualization
- **Bar Plots**:
  - Visualizations indicate that some ethnic groups are more likely to receive higher supervision levels than others. 

### Chi-Square Test
- **Statistical Association**:
  - The Chi-Square test indicates a statistically significant association between ethnicity and recommended supervision levels.

### Bias Level Assessment
Based on the analyses, the bias level can be categorized as **Level 4 (Significant Bias)**. This level suggests that there is a considerable discrepancy in supervision levels recommended for different ethnic groups.

### Recommendations
- **Further Investigation**: It's recommended to further explore the reasons behind the significant bias and consider factors such as historical, socio-economic, and systemic influences.
- **Policy Reevaluation**: Agencies should reevaluate their policies and practices to ensure fairness and equity in the recommendation of supervision levels.
- **Data Review**: Regular audits and reviews of data collection and analysis processes should be conducted to identify and mitigate biases.
