DECISION ANALYSIS

I have loaded the dataset from the provided path, which contains information on assessments, including details about the agencies involved. The column of interest for your query is "Agency_Text," which indicates the agency responsible for each assessment.

Next, I will analyze the distribution of assessments across different agencies to determine if there's a dominant agency or if the distribution is fairly even. I'll proceed with this analysis and provide a detailed report.

### Message Content:

To determine whether there's a dominant agency or if the distribution of assessments is fairly even, I'll perform a frequency analysis of the "Agency_Text" column. This will help identify how many assessments are attributed to each agency.

Let's proceed with the analysis.
Here's a detailed analysis of the distribution of assessments across different agencies in your dataset:

### Dataset Analyzed
- **Total Records**: 60,843
- **Relevant Feature**: `Agency_Text`, which identifies the agency responsible for each assessment.

### Analysis Process
1. **Frequency Analysis**: Count the number of assessments attributed to each agency.
2. **Visualization**: Create a bar chart to visually represent the distribution of assessments among agencies.

### Results
The frequency analysis yielded the following counts for each agency:

- **PRETRIAL**: 44,574 assessments
- **Probation**: 13,269 assessments
- **Parole**: 3,000 assessments

### Visualization
![Agency Distribution](generated_files/agency_distribution.png)

### Bias Detection and Interpretation
- **Dominance**: The agency labeled "PRETRIAL" is significantly dominant, conducting approximately 73.3% of all assessments.
- **Bias Level**: **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**, indicating that one agency is predominantly responsible for the majority of assessments.
- **Visual Evidence**: The chart shows a clear disparity between the agencies, with "PRETRIAL" having more than triple the assessments compared to "Probation" and over ten times more than "Parole."

### Recommendations
- **Further Investigation**: Determine if the dominance of "PRETRIAL" is justified by the nature of the cases or if adjustments are needed to ensure a more balanced distribution.
- **Consider Context**: Review the context in which these agencies operate. If "PRETRIAL" naturally handles more cases due to jurisdiction or case type, the bias may be justified.
- **Data Usage**: When utilizing this dataset, be aware of the potential influence of "PRETRIAL" bias on any analysis or conclusions drawn, especially if agency representation is a critical factor.
