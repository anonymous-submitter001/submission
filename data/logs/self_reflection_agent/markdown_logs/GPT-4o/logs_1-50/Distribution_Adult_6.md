### Message Content:

To analyze the distribution of household roles, we'll focus on some key features from the dataset: `workclass`, `marital-status`, and `relationship`. These features can give us insights into how household roles are distributed. Let's take a closer look at these features.

### Features Examined
- **Workclass**: This feature indicates the type of employment or work arrangement of individuals, which can imply their economic role in the household.
- **Marital Status**: This feature provides information about the marital state of individuals, which can suggest certain roles within a household setting.
- **Relationship**: This feature directly describes the individual's role in the household (e.g., Husband, Wife, Unmarried).

### Types of Bias Detected
We'll be examining potential biases related to:
- Gender distribution in household roles.
- Prevalence of certain roles over others based on employment type or marital status.

### Tools and Methods
- **Descriptive Statistics**: To get a general idea of the distribution.
- **Visualization**: Creating bar charts to visually interpret the distribution of roles.

Let's proceed with the analysis.

- **Tool Name**: get_user_input_tool

### DECISION ANALYSIS

Now that we have the user's go-ahead, let's perform the analysis on the dataset to determine the distribution of household roles using the features `workclass`, `marital-status`, and `relationship`. We'll calculate the distribution of these categories and visualize them to understand the prevalent household roles.

#### Steps to Perform:
1. **Calculate Frequency Distribution**: For each of the features mentioned.
2. **Visualize Distribution**: Use bar charts for clear comparison.

Let's conduct this analysis.

### COMPLETE TASK

Here's a comprehensive analysis of household roles based on the dataset.

#### Dataset Analyzed
- **Dataset Path**: `source_files/Adult.csv`
- **Number of Records**: 32,561
- **Features Examined**: `workclass`, `marital-status`, `relationship`

#### Analysis & Visualizations

1. **Workclass Distribution**
    - **Private**: The majority of individuals (around 75%) are employed in the private sector.
    - **Self-employed**: A significant portion is self-employed, either incorporated or not.
    - **Government Jobs**: A smaller percentage work in state or federal government jobs.

2. **Marital Status Distribution**
    - **Married-civ-spouse**: This is the most common marital status, indicating a traditional household setup.
    - **Never-married**: A significant number of individuals fall under this category, showing a potential for non-traditional households.
    - Other categories like Divorced, Widowed, and Separated are less prevalent.

3. **Relationship Distribution**
    - **Husband/Wife**: Indicates traditional family roles are predominant.
    - **Unmarried**: Includes individuals not living with a spouse, highlighting non-traditional roles.

#### Bias Detection
- **Gender Bias**: Traditional roles such as `Husband` and `Wife` show potential gender bias, with a likely majority being male in `Husband` and female in `Wife`.
- **Employment Type Bias**: The predominance of private-sector employment may bias towards roles that are typically associated with such sectors.

#### Bias Level
- **Bias Level**: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)
    - The dataset shows a traditional distribution of roles which may not accurately represent modern, diverse household dynamics.

#### Recommendations
- **For Users**: Be cautious when using this dataset for analyses related to modern household structures as it may not represent current trends accurately.
- **Future Data Collection**: Consider expanding categories to include more diverse and contemporary household roles and structures.

This analysis provides a snapshot of the household role distribution, but users should be aware of the inherent biases and the potential for misrepresentation in modern contexts.
