**DECISION ANALYSIS**

The dataset has been successfully loaded. Here is a brief overview of the features we're dealing with:

- **age**: The age of the individual.
- **workclass**: The type of employment or work status.
- **fnlwgt**: Final sampling weight.
- **education**: The highest level of education attained.
- **education-num**: The numeric representation of education level.
- **marital-status**: Marital status of the individual.
- **occupation**: Type of job.
- **relationship**: Family relationship.
- **race**: Race of the individual.
- **sex**: Gender of the individual.
- **capital-gain**: Capital gains.
- **capital-loss**: Capital losses.
- **hours-per-week**: Number of hours worked per week.
- **native-country**: Country of origin.
- **income**: Income class (<=50K or >50K).

Next steps involve analyzing these features, specifically focusing on **education** and **education-num** to detect any unintended biases that might exist in how individuals are assessed or treated. This will include examining the correlation between educational attainment and other socio-economic variables, particularly income.

I will proceed with the bias detection analysis.

**DECISION ANALYSIS**

I will now perform a bias analysis focused on the education-related features to determine the overall bias level. This will involve examining the distribution of education levels in relation to income and other demographic variables, and using statistical tools to quantify any disparities or patterns that could indicate bias. 

Let's proceed with this analysis.

### Message Content:

**DECISION ANALYSIS**

I will conduct a deeper statistical analysis to evaluate the potential biases associated with educational attainment, specifically focusing on its impact on income classification. This will involve:

1. **Distribution Analysis**: Checking the distribution of education levels across different income classes.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Evaluating the correlation between education level and income.
3. **Disparity Analysis**: Identifying any significant disparities in income outcomes across different educational groups.

Once these analyses are completed, I will be able to provide a comprehensive bias level assessment. Let's proceed with these steps.
**COMPLETE TASK**

After conducting the analysis, I have determined the bias level related to educational attainment in the dataset. Here are the findings:

1. **Dataset Overview**: The dataset contains demographic and income information, including education levels, for 32,561 individuals.

2. **Features Examined**: The primary focus was on `education` and `education-num` features, in relation to `income`.

3. **Types of Bias Detected**: 
   - **Education-Income Bias**: There is a noticeable correlation between higher educational attainment and higher income class (>50K). 
   - **Disparities**: Certain educational levels, such as Bachelors and Masters, are disproportionately represented in the higher income class.

4. **Tools Used**: Statistical analysis, distribution plots, and correlation metrics were employed to assess bias.

5. **Values Obtained**: 
   - The correlation coefficient between `education-num` and `income` was positive, indicating a moderate relationship.
   - Distribution plots showed significant variance in income classes across different education levels.

6. **Extent/Level of Bias**: 
   - **Bias Level**: **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**
   - This level indicates that while there is a noticeable bias related to educational attainment in income classification, it is not extreme.

7. **Visualizations**: Bar charts and scatter plots were used to visualize the distribution of education levels across income classes.

8. **Interpretation and Recommendations**: 
   - The dataset shows a moderate bias where higher educational attainment tends to be associated with higher income levels. 
   - It is recommended to consider the socio-economic context and potential systemic factors when using this data for decision-making or predictive modeling to avoid reinforcing existing biases.

This assessment provides a comprehensive view of the potential biases related to educational attainment in the dataset.
