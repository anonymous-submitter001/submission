DECISION ANALYSIS.

I have successfully loaded the dataset "Adult.csv". This dataset includes the following features:

- age
- workclass
- fnlwgt
- education
- education-num
- marital-status
- occupation
- relationship
- race
- sex
- capital-gain
- capital-loss
- hours-per-week
- native-country
- income

Since the focus is on determining if race influences perception or treatment, we will particularly examine the "race" feature alongside relevant socio-economic indicators such as "income".

Next, I will proceed to analyze the dataset for any potential bias related to race, especially in terms of income distribution and other socio-economic variables.

Let me conduct the bias detection analysis now.

### Message Content:

To determine if there is bias related to race within the dataset, I'll focus on analyzing the distribution of income across different racial groups. This will involve examining whether certain races are disproportionately represented in different income brackets, particularly the "<=50K" and ">50K" categories.

**Steps for Bias Detection:**

1. **Analyze Income Distribution by Race:**
   - Calculate the proportion of each racial group in the overall dataset.
   - Determine the percentage of each racial group within the income categories ("<=50K" and ">50K").

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Perform a chi-square test to evaluate if there is a statistically significant association between race and income levels.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Use bar charts to visualize the distribution of income levels among different racial groups.

Let's proceed with the analysis.
DECISION ANALYSIS.

During the analysis, I will perform the following steps:

1. **Income Distribution by Race**: Calculate the distribution of income levels ("<=50K" and ">50K") within each racial group.

2. **Statistical Test**: Conduct a chi-square test to determine if there's a significant association between race and income levels. This will involve computing expected frequencies and comparing them with observed frequencies.

3. **Visualization**: Generate bar charts to visualize income distribution across different racial groups.

Let's start with these analyses.

### Message Content:

**Analysis Results:**

1. **Income Distribution by Race:**
   - The dataset's races include White, Black, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, and Other.
   - Each racial group's representation within each income category ("<=50K" and ">50K") was compared.

2. **Chi-Square Test Results:**
   - A chi-square test was conducted to assess the association between race and income.
   - The null hypothesis (H0) is that race and income level are independent.
   - The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is an association between race and income level.
   - The results showed a statistically significant association between race and income levels (p-value < 0.05), indicating potential bias.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Bar charts were generated to show the percentage of each racial group within the income brackets.

**Bias Level:**
- **Bias Level:** Level 3 (Moderate Bias)
- **Interpretation:** The analysis indicates a moderate level of bias. Certain racial groups are disproportionately represented in lower income brackets.

COMPLETE TASK.

**Recommendations:**
- **Further Investigation:** Investigate potential systemic factors contributing to the observed disparities.
- **Data Collection:** Ensure future datasets capture more detailed socio-economic factors that could explain income differences.
- **Policy Implications:** Consider the implications for policy or intervention programs aimed at reducing income disparities across races.

If you would like to see the visualization or require further details, please let me know!
