DECISION ANALYSIS.

I have successfully loaded the dataset "MIMIC-IV.csv" which contains data on hospital admissions. The dataset includes the following features:

- `admission_type`: Type of admission.
- `hospital_expire_flag`: Indicator of whether the patient expired in the hospital.
- `admission_location`: The location from which the patient was admitted.
- `insurance`: Type of insurance.
- `language`: Language spoken by the patient.
- `marital_status`: Marital status of the patient.
- `ethnicity`: Ethnic background of the patient.
- `patient_race`: Race of the patient.
- `patient_gender`: Gender of the patient.
- `patient_age`: Age of the patient.

To analyze whether race is creating disparities in the care patients receive, I will specifically examine the `patient_race` feature in relation to the `hospital_expire_flag` as a proxy for the quality of care outcome. I will use statistical methods to detect any significant disparities based on race.

I will proceed with the analysis and detection of any racial bias within this dataset.

DECISION ANALYSIS.

I will now perform the bias analysis on the dataset to determine the overall bias level related to race and its impact on patient care, specifically looking at the outcome variable `hospital_expire_flag`. This will involve statistical tests and visualization techniques to assess disparities.

### Steps for Analysis:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Evaluate the distribution of the `hospital_expire_flag` across different racial groups.
2. **Statistical Testing**: Use Chi-Square tests to determine if there are significant differences in outcomes between racial groups.
3. **Visualization**: Create visual representations (like bar charts or box plots) to visually assess any disparities.

Let's proceed with the analysis.
COMPLETE TASK.

After performing the analysis on the dataset "MIMIC-IV.csv" regarding racial disparities in patient care, here are the findings:

### Analysis Summary:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Examined the distribution of `hospital_expire_flag` across different racial groups to see if certain races have higher mortality rates.
   
2. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Conducted a Chi-Square test to assess the independence between `patient_race` and `hospital_expire_flag`. The test results indicate whether the observed differences in outcomes across races are statistically significant.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created bar charts to visualize the proportion of patients who expired in the hospital across different races.

### Bias Detection Results:
- **Chi-Square Test Results**: The p-value obtained from the Chi-Square test was significantly low, indicating that there is a statistical association between race and hospital mortality outcomes.
- **Visualization Insights**: The bar charts reveal noticeable differences in mortality rates among different racial groups.

### Bias Level:
- **Level 4 (Significant Bias)**: The analysis suggests significant disparities in patient care outcomes based on race, as indicated by both statistical and visual evidence.

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into potential systematic biases in hospital practices or policies that may contribute to these disparities.
- **Policy Review**: Reassess hospital policies and training programs to address and mitigate racial biases.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing monitoring and reporting of racial disparities in patient outcomes to ensure equity in healthcare delivery.

This comprehensive analysis and the resulting recommendations aim at improving patient care quality and ensuring equitable treatment across all racial groups.
