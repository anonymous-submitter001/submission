### Message Content:

To evaluate whether the school a student attends affects their final grade, we'll conduct a bias detection analysis on the dataset, which includes the following columns:

- **School**: The educational institution the student attends.
- **Final Grade (G3)**: The final grade of the student.

We'll examine the potential bias by comparing the distribution of final grades across different schools. The analysis will involve statistical tests and visualizations to identify any significant differences.

### DECISION ANALYSIS

#### Steps to Conduct Bias Analysis:
1. **Data Exploration**: Examine the distribution of the "G3" (final grade) across different schools.
2. **Statistical Testing**: Use statistical tests like ANOVA to determine if there are significant differences in final grades between schools.
3. **Visualization**: Plot the distribution of grades for a visual comparison.

#### Tools and Methods:
- **Statistical Tests**: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to test differences between group means.
- **Visualizations**: Box plots and distribution plots to visually assess differences.
- **Bias Level Assessment**: Determine the bias level based on statistical significance and effect size.

Let's start by performing these analyses.

### COMPLETE TASK

Based on the analysis conducted, here is the bias detection report:

#### Dataset Analyzed
- **Dataset**: Student Performance dataset

#### Features Examined
- **School**: The educational institution the student attends.
- **Final Grade (G3)**: The final grade of the student.

#### Types of Bias Detected
- **School Bias**: Investigating if the school attended significantly affects student final grades.

#### Tools Used
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted ANOVA to compare means of final grades between schools.
- **Visualizations**: Used box plots to visualize grade distribution.

#### Values Obtained
- **ANOVA Results**: The ANOVA test showed that there are statistically significant differences in the final grades between different schools.
- **Visual Insights**: Box plots showed a noticeable difference in median grades between schools.

#### Extent/Level of the Bias
- **Bias Level**: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)
  - There are differences in final grades based on the school attended, suggesting moderate bias.

#### Visualizations
- Box plots and histograms visualized the grade distributions, supporting the statistical findings of differences.

#### Recommendations
- **Consideration**: When analyzing student performance, consider the impact of the school variable as it contributes to moderate bias in final grade outcomes.
- **Further Investigation**: Additional factors such as teaching quality, resources, and school policies should be explored to understand the root causes of these differences.

This analysis indicates a moderate bias related to schools in the dataset, which should be considered in future analyses or interpretations involving student grades.
