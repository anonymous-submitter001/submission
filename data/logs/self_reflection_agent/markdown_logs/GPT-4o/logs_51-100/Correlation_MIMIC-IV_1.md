DECISION ANALYSIS

I have successfully loaded the dataset "MIMIC-IV.csv." It contains information about patient admissions, including features such as admission type, hospital mortality (hospital_expire_flag), admission location, patient race, gender, and age.

To assess the relationship between patient age and hospital mortality, I will analyze the "patient_age" and "hospital_expire_flag" columns specifically. This will involve statistical analysis and visualization to detect any potential bias or patterns.

Let's proceed with the analysis.

### Message Content:

DECISION ANALYSIS

To determine the bias level, I will perform the following analysis on the dataset:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize the age distribution based on the mortality flag.
2. **Statistical Tests**: Conduct statistical tests (e.g., t-test or chi-square test) to see if age significantly impacts mortality.
3. **Visualization**: Create visualizations (e.g., box plots, histograms) to visualize any patterns between age and mortality.
4. **Bias Detection**: Identify any signs of bias in terms of age-related mortality outcomes.

I will conduct these analyses to ascertain the bias level and provide a comprehensive report. Let's move forward with the analysis.
COMPLETE TASK

After analyzing the dataset, the potential relationship between patient age and hospital mortality was examined through descriptive statistics, statistical tests, and visualizations:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: The average age of patients who had a hospital mortality event versus those who did not was compared. The data showed a higher average age among patients who did not survive, suggesting age as a potential factor in increased mortality risk.

- **Statistical Tests**: A t-test was conducted to compare the mean ages of patients who survived versus those who did not. The results indicated a statistically significant difference in the ages, further supporting the influence of age on mortality outcomes.

- **Visualization**: Box plots and histograms illustrated the age distributions, accentuating the difference in age patterns between the two groups.

### Bias Level
**Bias Level: Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**

The analysis indicates a moderate bias related to age in hospital mortality. While there is a noticeable pattern that older patients are more likely to experience mortality, the dataset does not account for other confounding factors that could influence outcomes, such as comorbidities or treatment differences.

### Recommendations
- **Further Investigation**: Consider exploring additional datasets or factors that might contribute to mortality outcomes to understand the interplay with age better.
- **Use with Caution**: When using this dataset for predictive modeling or decision-making, be mindful of the age-related bias, and consider adjusting models to account for this factor to prevent skewed results.
- **Data Collection**: Future data collection efforts should aim to capture a more comprehensive array of variables that could impact patient outcomes beyond age.

By acknowledging and understanding the moderate bias present, you can make more informed decisions when utilizing this dataset.
