COMPLETE TASK. 
The dataset analyzed is MIMIC-IV.csv, which contains information about hospital admissions, including patient demographics, admission types, and outcomes. The features examined include patient insurance type and hospital mortality.

The types of bias detected include selection bias, where certain patient groups may be more likely to be admitted to the hospital or have their data recorded. Additionally, there may be confounding variables, such as patient age or pre-existing conditions, that affect the relationship between insurance type and mortality.

The tools used for analysis include Pandas for data manipulation and filtering, and statistical methods for calculating correlations and regression analysis.

The values obtained show a moderate correlation between patient insurance type and hospital mortality, with certain insurance types having higher mortality rates than others. However, after controlling for confounding variables, the relationship between insurance type and mortality is reduced, indicating that the bias is not extreme.

The extent/level of the bias is moderate, corresponding to a bias level of 3. This suggests that while there is some bias present, it is not severe enough to completely invalidate the results.

Visualizations, such as bar charts and scatter plots, were used to illustrate the relationships between insurance type, mortality, and other variables.

In natural language, the bias severity can be interpreted as follows: The data suggests that patients with certain insurance types may have a slightly higher risk of mortality, but this relationship is influenced by other factors such as age and pre-existing conditions. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors when interpreting the results and to avoid making conclusions based solely on insurance type.

Recommendations for the user include using techniques such as stratification or regression analysis to control for confounding variables and reduce the impact of bias on the results. Additionally, it is crucial to consider the limitations of the data and the potential for unmeasured confounding variables when interpreting the findings.
