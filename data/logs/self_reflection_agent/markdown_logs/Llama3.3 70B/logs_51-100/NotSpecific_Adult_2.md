DECISION ANALYSIS. 
The dataset used for this analysis is the Adult dataset, which contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education, and income. The features examined in this analysis are education and income. 
The tools used for this analysis are the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Matplotlib library for data visualization. 
The values obtained from this analysis show that there is a significant difference in income between individuals with different levels of education. 
The extent of the bias is significant, with individuals having higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes. 
A bar chart was created to visualize the relationship between education and income, showing that individuals with higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes. 
The natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that there is a significant bias in the dataset, with individuals having higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes. 
The recommendation for the user is to consider the potential bias in the dataset when using it for decision-making purposes, and to explore ways to mitigate the bias, such as by using techniques like data preprocessing or feature engineering. 

 COMPLETE TASK.

COMPLETE TASK.

The dataset used for this analysis is the Adult dataset, which contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education, and income. The features examined in this analysis are education and income.

The tools used for this analysis are the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Matplotlib library for data visualization.

The values obtained from this analysis show that there is a significant difference in income between individuals with different levels of education. Individuals with higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes.

The extent of the bias is significant, with a bias level of 4 (Significant Bias). This means that the dataset is likely to produce unfair outcomes if used for decision-making purposes without proper mitigation.

A bar chart was created to visualize the relationship between education and income, showing that individuals with higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes.

The natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that there is a significant bias in the dataset, with individuals having higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes. This bias could lead to unfair treatment of individuals with lower levels of education.

The recommendation for the user is to consider the potential bias in the dataset when using it for decision-making purposes, and to explore ways to mitigate the bias, such as by using techniques like data preprocessing or feature engineering.

Here is a summary of the findings:

* Dataset: Adult dataset
* Features examined: Education and income
* Tools used: Pandas and Matplotlib
* Bias level: 4 (Significant Bias)
* Recommendation: Consider potential bias and explore ways to mitigate it.
