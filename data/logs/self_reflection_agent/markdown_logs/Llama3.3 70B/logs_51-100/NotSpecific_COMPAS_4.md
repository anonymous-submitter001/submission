COMPLETE TASK. 
The dataset analyzed is the COMPAS dataset, which contains information about criminal defendants in Florida. The features examined include demographic information such as age, sex, and race, as well as criminal history and risk assessment scores. 

The types of bias detected in this dataset include racial bias, with African American defendants being more likely to be classified as high-risk than white defendants, even when controlling for criminal history and other factors. Additionally, there is a bias towards assigning higher risk scores to younger defendants.

The tools used to detect bias include statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms, which were used to identify patterns and disparities in the data.

The values obtained from the analysis indicate a significant bias in the dataset, with a bias level of 4 out of 5. This indicates a significant disparity in the treatment of different groups, which could have serious consequences in the criminal justice system.

Visualizations of the data, such as histograms and scatter plots, were used to illustrate the disparities and biases in the data.

In natural language, the bias severity can be interpreted as significant, with certain groups being disproportionately affected by the bias in the dataset. This could lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate existing social inequalities.

Recommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset include being aware of the potential biases and taking steps to mitigate them, such as using techniques like data preprocessing and feature engineering to reduce the impact of biased features. Additionally, it is recommended to use fairness metrics and algorithms to evaluate and address bias in the dataset. 

Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of carefully evaluating and addressing bias in datasets, particularly in high-stakes applications like the criminal justice system.
