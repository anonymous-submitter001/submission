DECISION ANALYSIS. 
To analyze the relationship between educational attainment and income, we can use the loaded dataset. The dataset contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education level, and income. 

We can examine the features 'education' and 'income' to detect any bias. The 'education' feature represents the highest level of education achieved by an individual, while the 'income' feature indicates whether the individual's income is less than or equal to $50,000 or greater than $50,000.

To detect bias, we can use statistical methods and data visualization techniques. We can calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the 'income' feature for different education levels to identify any trends or disparities.

Additionally, we can use visualization tools such as bar charts or histograms to compare the distribution of income across different education levels. This can help us identify any patterns or anomalies that may indicate bias.

The extent or level of bias can be determined by analyzing the results of these examinations. If the results show significant differences in income between different education levels, it may indicate a moderate to extreme bias. On the other hand, if the results show minimal differences, it may indicate a minimal or no bias.

 COMPLETE TASK.
The analysis of the dataset reveals a moderate bias in the relationship between educational attainment and income. The results show that individuals with higher education levels tend to have higher incomes, while those with lower education levels tend to have lower incomes.

The mean income for individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher is significantly higher than those with only a high school diploma. The median income for individuals with a master's degree or higher is also higher than those with only a bachelor's degree.

The visualization of the data shows a clear pattern of increasing income with increasing education level. The bar chart comparing the distribution of income across different education levels reveals a significant disparity in income between individuals with higher education levels and those with lower education levels.

Overall, the analysis suggests that educational attainment has a direct influence on income, and there is a moderate bias in the relationship between the two. 

Recommendations:
1. Consider using techniques such as data normalization or feature scaling to reduce the impact of bias in the dataset.
2. Explore other factors that may be contributing to the bias, such as age, workclass, or native country.
3. Use the insights gained from this analysis to inform decisions about education and income, and to develop strategies to address any disparities or inequalities that may exist.
