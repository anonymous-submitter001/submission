### Message Content:

DECISION ANALYSIS. 
The dataset analyzed is the Adult dataset, which contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education, and income. 
The features examined are gender, age, workclass, education, and income. 
The types of bias detected are gender bias and age bias. 
The tools used are data visualization and statistical analysis. 
The values obtained show that there is a significant difference in the distribution of males and females in the dataset, with males making up about 67% of the population and females making up about 33%. 
The extent/level of the bias is Level 4 (Significant Bias). 
The natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that the dataset is significantly biased towards males, which could lead to unfair outcomes in machine learning models trained on this data. 
Recommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset are to consider techniques to address the bias, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, or using bias mitigation algorithms. 
COMPLETE TASK.
