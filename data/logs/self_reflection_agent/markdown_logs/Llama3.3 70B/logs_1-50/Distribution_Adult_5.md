### Message Content:

DECISION ANALYSIS. 
The dataset analyzed is the Adult dataset, which contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education, and income. 
The features examined include age, workclass, education, and income. 
The types of bias detected include bias in the distribution of occupations and bias in the income levels. 
The tools used include data visualization and statistical analysis. 
The values obtained show that certain occupations dominate the dataset, and the distribution of occupations is not relatively even. 
The extent/level of the bias is significant, with a bias level of 4 (Significant Bias). 
Visualizations show that the majority of the individuals in the dataset are from the "Private" workclass, and the income levels are biased towards "<=50K". 
My natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that the dataset is significantly biased towards certain occupations and income levels, which may affect the accuracy of any models trained on this data. 
Recommendations for the user regarding the use of the dataset include considering the potential impact of the bias on the results and taking steps to address the bias, such as data preprocessing or using techniques to reduce bias. 
COMPLETE TASK.
