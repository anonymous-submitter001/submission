### Message Content:

DECISION ANALYSIS. 
The dataset analyzed is the Adult dataset, which contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education, and native country. The features examined include the distribution of native countries and the relationship between native country and income. 
The tools used for this analysis include the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, and the Matplotlib library for data visualization. 
The values obtained show that the native country distribution is not well-balanced, with the United States being the most represented country. 
The extent/level of the bias is significant, with a bias level of 4, indicating a significant imbalance in the representation of different native countries. 
A bar chart visualization of the native country distribution shows that the United States has a significantly higher number of individuals than any other country. 
The natural language interpretation of the bias severity is that the dataset has a significant bias towards individuals from the United States, which may impact the accuracy of models trained on this data. 
Recommendations for the user include considering the use of techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to balance the dataset, or using models that are robust to class imbalance. 
COMPLETE TASK.
