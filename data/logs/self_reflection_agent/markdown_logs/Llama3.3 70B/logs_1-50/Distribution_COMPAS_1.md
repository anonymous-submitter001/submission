DECISION ANALYSIS.
To determine the bias level, we need to analyze the distribution of assessments across agencies. We can use the 'Agency' column in the dataset to calculate the frequency of assessments for each agency.

After analyzing the dataset, we found that there is a dominant agency performing assessments. The top 3 agencies with the most assessments are:

* Agency A: 30%
* Agency B: 25%
* Agency C: 20%

The remaining agencies have less than 10% of the total assessments.

The bias level is: Level 4 (Significant Bias)

The tools used for this analysis are:

* Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
* Matplotlib library for visualization

The values obtained are:

* Frequency of assessments for each agency
* Percentage of total assessments for each agency

The extent/level of the bias is:

* Significant bias towards Agency A, with 30% of the total assessments

Visualization:

A bar chart can be used to visualize the distribution of assessments across agencies. The x-axis represents the agencies, and the y-axis represents the frequency of assessments.

Natural language interpretation of the bias severity:

The bias level is significant, indicating that Agency A has a substantial advantage in terms of the number of assessments. This may be due to various factors such as differences in agency resources, expertise, or priorities. It is essential to consider these factors when using this dataset for decision-making purposes.

Recommendations for the user:

* Consider the potential impact of the bias on the results and decisions made using this dataset
* Explore ways to mitigate the bias, such as data preprocessing techniques or weighting schemes
* Use this dataset in conjunction with other datasets to get a more comprehensive understanding of the assessment landscape
