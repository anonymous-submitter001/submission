DECISION ANALYSIS.
The dataset used for this analysis is the Adult dataset, which contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education, and income. The features examined in this analysis are age and income. 

The tools used for this analysis are the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Matplotlib library for data visualization.

The age distribution across individuals is not balanced, with certain age groups dominating. The majority of the individuals in the dataset are between 25 and 55 years old, with a peak at around 35-40 years old.

The extent/level of the bias is moderate, with a bias level of 3. This means that the dataset is not extremely biased, but there is still a noticeable imbalance in the age distribution.

Here is a visualization of the age distribution:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('source_files/Adult.csv')

# Plot the age distribution
plt.hist(df['age'], bins=10)
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Age Distribution')
plt.show()
```
This visualization shows that the age distribution is skewed towards the 25-55 age range, with a peak at around 35-40 years old.

Based on this analysis, it is recommended that the user be aware of the potential bias in the dataset and take steps to address it, such as oversampling the underrepresented age groups or using techniques to reduce the impact of the bias.

COMPLETE TASK.
