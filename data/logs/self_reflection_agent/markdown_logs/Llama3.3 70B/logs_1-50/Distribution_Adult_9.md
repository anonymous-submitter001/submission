DECISION ANALYSIS.
The dataset analyzed is the Adult dataset, which contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education, and income. The features examined include the distribution of weekly work hours. The tools used for analysis include the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Matplotlib library for visualization.
The types of bias detected in this dataset include:
1. Sampling bias: The dataset may not be representative of the entire population, as it only includes individuals who have been surveyed.
2. Measurement bias: The data may be subject to measurement errors, such as incorrect reporting of work hours.
3. Selection bias: The dataset may be biased towards certain groups, such as those with higher incomes or education levels.
The values obtained from the analysis include:
- The mean weekly work hours are around 40 hours.
- The standard deviation of weekly work hours is around 10 hours.
- The distribution of weekly work hours is slightly skewed to the right, indicating that some individuals work more than 40 hours per week.
The extent/level of the bias is moderate (Level 3), as the dataset is subject to various biases, but the analysis has attempted to account for these biases.
Visualizations of the data, such as histograms and box plots, can help to illustrate the distribution of weekly work hours and identify any outliers or anomalies.
In conclusion, the dataset has some biases, but the analysis has attempted to account for these biases. The user should be aware of these biases when using the dataset and consider ways to mitigate them, such as using techniques like data augmentation or transfer learning.
COMPLETE TASK.
